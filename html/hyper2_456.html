<h2>Results from the NOCS volleyball league</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Results from the <abbr><span class="acronym">NOCS</span></abbr> volleyball league.  Object
<code>volleyball_table</code> is a matrix in which each column corresponds to
a player and each row corresponds to a volleyball set; <code>volleyball</code>
is the corresponding likelihood function in the form of a <code>hyper2</code>
distribution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(volleyball)</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A volleyball <dfn>set</dfn> is a Bernoulli trial between two disjoint subsets of
the players.  The two subsets are denoted (after the game) as the
“winners” and the “losers”: these are denoted by <code>1</code>
and <code>0</code> respectively.
</p>
<p>Thus the first line reads of <code>volleyball_results</code> reads:
</p>
<pre>
 p1  p2  p3  p4  p5  p6  p7  p8  p9 
 1    0  NA   1   0   0  NA   1  NA
</pre>
<p>showing that the teams were <code>p1</code>, <code>p4</code> and <code>p8</code> against
<code>p2</code>, <code>p5</code> and <code>p6</code>; players <code>p3</code>, <code>p7</code> and
<code>p9</code> did not play.
</p>
<p>These datasets illustrate the fact that such Bernoulli trials are only
weakly informative.  
</p>
<p>These objects can be generated by running script
<code>inst/volleyball.Rmd</code>, which includes some further discussion and
technical documentation and creates file <code>volleyball.rda</code> which
resides in the <code>data/</code> directory.
