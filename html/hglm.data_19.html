<h2>Semiconductor data set from GenStat.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The semiconductor data set is obtained from a 2<code class="reqn">\mbox{\textasciicircum}</code>(6-2) factorial design conducted in a semiconductor plant. The design variables, Lamination (3 factors; Temperature, Time and Pressure) and Firing  (3 factors; Temperature, Cycle Time and Dew Point), are each taken at two levels. The goal of the original data analysis was to model the curvature or camber (taken in 1e-4 in./in.) as a function of the desing variables. The data set is taken from GenStat 11.1. It is also used in Lee et al. (2006) where Mayers et al. (2002) is reffered to as the the original source of the data.
