<h2>Literature In Vivo Data on Doses Causing Neurological Effects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Studies were selected from Table 1 in Mundy et al., 2015, as
the studies in that publication were cited as examples of
compounds with evidence for developmental neurotoxicity. There
were sufficient in vitro toxicokinetic data available for this
package for only 6 of the 42 chemicals.
