<h2>Jester dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A likelihood function for the Jester datasets</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(jester)</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Object <code>jester</code> is a likelihood function for the 91 jokes rated by
the first 150 respondents in file ‘<span class="file">jester_dataset_1_3.zip</span>’, taken
from Goldberg et al.  Object <code>jester_maxp</code> is the result of running
<code>maxp(jester)</code>.  The results table of (nearly) all jokes and
respondents is given as <code>jester_table</code> in which each row is a joke
and each column a respondent.
</p>
<p>The dataset is interesting because it has been analysed by many workers,
including Goldberg, for patterns; here I assume that all the respondents
behave identically (but randomly).  It is included here because it is a
very severe numerical challenge in the context of the <code>hyper2</code>
package.  I am not convinced that <code>maxjest</code> is even close to the
true evaluate.
</p>
<p>Objects <code>jester</code>, <code>jester_table</code>, and <code>jester_maxp</code> can
be generated by running script ‘<span class="file">inst/jester.Rmd</span>’, which includes
some further technical documentation.  This file takes about 10 minutes
to run.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# maxp(jester)  # takes too long

# Note that the possibly poor identification of the evaluate
#  nevertheless allows us to reject the null of equality:

(LAM &lt;- -2*(loglik(equalp(jester),jester)-loglik(jester_maxp,jester)))
pval &lt;- pchisq(LAM,df=size(jester),lower.tail=FALSE)
