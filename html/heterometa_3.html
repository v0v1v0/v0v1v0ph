<h2>Convert Various Meta-Analysis Heterogeneity Measures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Published meta-analyses routinely present one of the
   measures of heterogeneity introduced in Higgins and Thompson
   (2002) &lt;doi:10.1002/sim.1186&gt;. For critiquing articles
   it is often better to convert to another of
   those measures. Some
   conversions are provided here and confidence intervals are also
   available.</p>

<p>Published meta–analyses often only provide
a subset of the
heterogeneity measures first described
in Higgins and Thompson (2002).
This package provides a way of converting between
some of them.
It allows for the input of I2, Q or p
and outputs Q, H, I2, and confidence intervals
for them.
It also contains the data used as examples
in that original article.
