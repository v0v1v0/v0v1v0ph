<h2>hansard: Provides Easy Downloading Capabilities for the UK Parliament API</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides functions to request data from the data.parliament.uk APIs.
Because of the structure of the data.parliament.uk API, there is a named
function for each type of available data for ease of use. Functions for
each new API will be added as and when they become available on
&lt;data.parliament.uk&gt;. The API is rate limited to returning 5500 rows
per request in some instances, though this has been inconsistent in testing.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The API itself is still in beta, and only about half of the planned datasets
are currently available. The package name is optimistic, as the
actual contents of the Hansard are not yet available through this API.
</p>
<p>In addition to the standard function names, each function in the
<code>hansard</code> package has a wrapper where the name is prefixed with
<code>'hansard_'</code>. For example, both <code>bills()</code> and
<code>hansard_bills()</code> will return the same result. This is because
function names are taken from the specific API on
<a href="http://explore.data.parliament.uk/">http://explore.data.parliament.uk/</a>, but they are often not very
informative and could clash with functions in other packages (e.g.
<code>bills()</code> is not a term unique to the British parliament).
</p>
<p>For more details please see the
<a href="https://docs.evanodell.com/hansard/articles/introduction">vignette</a>,
or the API documentation on <a href="http://explore.data.parliament.uk/">http://explore.data.parliament.uk/</a>.
</p>
<p>This package is in no way officially related to or endorsed by the UK
Parliamentary Data Service.
