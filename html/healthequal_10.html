<h2>Mean difference from the best-performing subgroup (weighted) (MDBW)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Mean Difference from the Best-Performing Subgroup (MDB) is an absolute
measure of inequality that shows the mean difference between each population
subgroup and the subgroup with the best estimate. For the weighted version
(MDBW), subgroups are weighted according to their population share.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mdbw(
  pop,
  est,
  se = NULL,
  favourable_indicator,
  scaleval,
  sim = NULL,
  seed = 123456,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of people within each subgroup.
Population size must be available for all subgroups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>est</code></td>
<td>
<p>The subgroup estimate.
Estimates must be available for all subgroups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>The standard error of the subgroup estimate.
If this is missing, 95% confidence intervals of MDBW cannot be calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>favourable_indicator</code></td>
<td>
<p>Records whether the indicator is
favourable (1) or non-favourable (0). Favourable indicators measure
desirable health events where the ultimate goal is
to achieve a maximum level (such as skilled birth attendance).
Non-favourable indicators measure undesirable health events where
the ultimate goal is to achieve a minimum level (such as under-five
mortality rate).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaleval</code></td>
<td>
<p>The scale of the indicator. For example, the
scale of an indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The
scale of an indicator measured as a rate per 1000 population is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of simulations to estimate 95% confidence intervals</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>The random number generator (RNG) state for the 95% confidence
interval simulation</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments passed to or from other methods.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The weighted version (MDBW) is calculated as the weighted average of
absolute differences between the subgroup estimates and the estimate for the
best-performing subgroup, divided by the number of subgroups. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp;
Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and MDBW is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
MDBW results.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> MDBW only has positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. MDBW is zero if there is no
inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; absolute; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered; more than two subgroups
</p>
