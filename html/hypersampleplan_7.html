<h2>Attribute sampling plans when the sample size n is known and fixed

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attribute sampling is an important field of statistical quality control. When a lot is submitted for inspection, a sampling plan must specify both the number of samples to be drawn from the lot as well as the acceptance number which is the maximum number of defective items found in the sample that would still make the lot acceptable. Since the sample is not free of defective, there are probabilities of accepting a lot which is actually not acceptable and of rejecting one which is acceptable. The hypergeometric distribution using Chebyshev Polynomials forms the basis for calculating those exact probabilities.
</p>
<p>This program is designed to compute the acceptance number c when the sample size n is known and fixed.
