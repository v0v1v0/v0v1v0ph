<h2>Create a labelled vector.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A labelled vector is a common data structure in other statistical
environments, allowing you to assign text labels to specific values.
This class makes it possible to import such labelled vectors in to R
without loss of fidelity. This class provides few methods, as I
expect you'll coerce to a standard R class (e.g. a <code>factor()</code>)
soon after importing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">labelled(x = double(), labels = NULL, label = NULL)

is.labelled(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector to label. Must be either numeric (integer or double) or
character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named vector or <code>NULL</code>. The vector should be the same type
as <code>x</code>. Unlike factors, labels don't need to be exhaustive: only a fraction
of the values might be labelled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>A short, human-readable description of the vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">s1 &lt;- labelled(c("M", "M", "F"), c(Male = "M", Female = "F"))
s2 &lt;- labelled(c(1, 1, 2), c(Male = 1, Female = 2))
s3 &lt;- labelled(
  c(1, 1, 2),
  c(Male = 1, Female = 2),
  label = "Assigned sex at birth"
)

# Unfortunately it's not possible to make as.factor work for labelled objects
# so instead use as_factor. This works for all types of labelled vectors.
as_factor(s1)
as_factor(s1, levels = "values")
as_factor(s2)

# Other statistical software supports multiple types of missing values
s3 &lt;- labelled(
  c("M", "M", "F", "X", "N/A"),
  c(Male = "M", Female = "F", Refused = "X", "Not applicable" = "N/A")
)
s3
as_factor(s3)

# Often when you have a partially labelled numeric vector, labelled values
# are special types of missing. Use zap_labels to replace labels with missing
# values
x &lt;- labelled(c(1, 2, 1, 2, 10, 9), c(Unknown = 9, Refused = 10))
zap_labels(x)
