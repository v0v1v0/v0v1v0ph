<h2>Discretised version of coliform counts in sea-water samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Discretised version of counts of faecal coliform bacteria in sea water
samples collected at seven locations near Sydney NSW, Australia.
There were four “controls”: Longreef, Bondi East, Port
Hacking “50”, and Port Hacking “100” and three
“outfalls”: Bondi Offshore, Malabar Offshore and North
Head Offshore.  At each location measurements were made at four
depths: 0, 20, 40, and 60 meters.  A large fraction of the counts
are missing values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SydColDisc</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 5432 observations on the following 6 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor consisting of a discretisation of counts
of faecal coliform count bacteria in sea water samples.  The
original measures were obtained by a repeated dilution process.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The data were discretised using the <code>cut()</code>
function with breaks given by <code>c(0,1,5,25,200,Inf)</code> and
labels equal to <code>c("lo","mlo","m","mhi","hi")</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>locn</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>Longreef</code>,
<code>Bondi East</code>, <code>Port Hacking 50</code>, <code>Port Hacking
    100</code>, <code>Bondi Offshore</code>, <code>Malabar Offshore</code> and
<code>North Head Offshore</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>depth</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>0</code> (0 metres),
<code>20</code> (20 metres), <code>40</code> (40 metres), <code>60</code> (60 metres).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ma.com</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the Malabar sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nh.com</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the North Head sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bo.com</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code>,
indicating whether the Bondi Offshore sewage outfall had been commissioned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The observations corresponding to each location-depth combination
constitute a (discrete valued) time series.  The sampling
interval is ostensibly 1 week; distinct time series are ostensibly
synchronous.  The measurements were made over a 194 week period.
Due to exigencies of weather, the unreliabitity of boats and
other factors the collection times were actually highly irregular
and have been rounded to the neares week.  Often no sample was
obtained at a given site within a week of the putative collection
time, in which the observed count is given as a missing value. In
fact over <b>75%</b> of the counts are missing.  See Turner et
al. (1998) for more detail.
</p>


<h3>Modelling</h3>

<p>The hidden Markov models applied in the paper Turner et
al. (1998) and in the paper Turner (2008) used a numeric version
of the response in this data set.  The numeric response was
essentially a square root transformation of the original data,
and the resulting values were modelled in terms of a Poisson
distribution.  See the references for details.
