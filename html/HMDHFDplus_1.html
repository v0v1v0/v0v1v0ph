<h2>
<code>age2int()</code> convert the Age column from standard HMD or HFD tables to integer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Long the bane of many an HMD/HFD user is that the age column must be read into R as a factor or character vector, yet we'd like to use it as integer or numeric. This function strips symbols that are used to indicate the open age groups ("12-","55+","110+"), and coerces to integer format. This function is called by <code>HFDparse()</code> and <code>HMDparse()</code>, and so forth.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Age</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the Age column from and HMD or HFD data object that has been read directly into R. This may be a factor or character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is written for the sake of various parse functions.
