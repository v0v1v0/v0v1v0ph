<h2>Include Content From a File</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Load HTML, text, or rendered Markdown from a file and turn into HTML.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">includeHTML(path)

includeText(path)

includeMarkdown(path)

includeCSS(path, ...)

includeScript(path, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path of the file to be included. It is highly recommended to
use a relative path (the base path being the Shiny application directory),
not an absolute path.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any additional attributes to be applied to the generated tag.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions provide a convenient way to include an extensive amount of
HTML, textual, Markdown, CSS, or JavaScript content, rather than using a
large literal R string.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>includeText</code> escapes its contents, but does no other processing.
This means that hard breaks and multiple spaces will be rendered as they
usually are in HTML: as a single space character. If you are looking for
preformatted text, wrap the call with <code>pre()</code>, or consider using
<code>includeMarkdown</code> instead.
</p>
<p>The <code>includeMarkdown</code> function requires the <code>markdown</code>
package.
