<h2>Relative concentration index (RCI)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The relative concentration index (RCI) is a relative measure of inequality
that shows the gradient across population subgroups. It indicates the extent
to which an indicator is concentrated among disadvantaged or advantaged
subgroups, on a relative scale. RCI can be calculated using disaggregated
data and individual-level data. Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted
according to their population share, while individuals are weighted by
sample weight in the case of data from surveys.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rci(
  est,
  subgroup_order,
  scaleval = NULL,
  pop = NULL,
  weight = NULL,
  psu = NULL,
  strata = NULL,
  fpc = NULL,
  method = NULL,
  lmin = NULL,
  lmax = NULL,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  force = FALSE,
  ...
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>RCI is calculated by dividing the absolute concentration index (ACI)
by the setting average. RCI may be more easily interpreted
when multiplied by 100. The calculation of ACI is based on a
ranking of the whole population from the most-disadvantaged
subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup (at rank 1),
which is inferred from the ranking and size of the subgroups.
For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber, A., &amp; Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> RCI is bounded between -1 and +1 (or between -100
and +100, when multiplied by 100). The larger the absolute value of RCI,
the higher the level of inequality. For favourable indicators, positive
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the advantaged,
while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among
the disadvantaged. For adverse indicators, it is the reverse: positive
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged,
while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the
advantaged. RCI is zero if there is no inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Ordered; more than two subgroups
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The confidence intervals are approximate
and might be biased.
