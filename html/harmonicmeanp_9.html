<h2>
Compute a combined <em>p</em>-value via the model-averaged mean maximized likelihood ratio
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The model averaging by mean maximum likelihood (MAMML) test combines likelihood ratio tests and corrects for multiple testing while controlling the weak-sense family-wise error rate in a way that is more powerful than common alternatives including Bonferroni and Simes procedures and possesses theoretical robustness to positive correlations between tests and unequal weights. It is a frequentist analogue to Bayesian model averaging, is theoretically grounded in generalized central limit theorem, and motivates the simpler and better-calibrated harmonic mean <em>p</em>-value (HMP) test. The model-averaged mean maximized likelihood (MAMML) is defined as the (possibly weighted) arithmetic mean of the maximized likelihood ratios from a series of likelihood ratio tests comparing mutually exclusive alternative hypotheses with the same nested null hypothesis based on the exact same data.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.mamml(R, nu, w = NULL, L = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric vector of one or more maximized likelihood ratios. Missing values (NAs) will cause a missing value to be returned.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nu</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric scalar or vector for the degrees of freedom corresponding to all or each of the maximized likelihood ratios respectively.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>

<p>An optional numeric vector of weights that can be interpreted as prior model probabilities for each of the alternative hypotheses represented by the individual <em>p</em>-values. The sum of the weights cannot exceed one but may be less than one, which is interpreted as meaning that some <em>p</em>-values have been excluded.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of constituent maximized likelihood ratios. If ignored, it defaults to the length of argument <code>R</code>, with a warning.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The model-averaged mean maximized likelihood ratio is returned.
