<h2>
Null distribution for overlap statistics
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates null distribution of four different overlap statistics under the null hypothesis that two samples are drawn from the same population.
Observed value of overlap statistic is calculated from inputed hypervolumes.
calculates p value for observed value of each statistic with respect to the generated null distributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Generating overlap statistics can be parallelized using the <code>cores</code> argument.  
</p>
<p>hypervolume_overlap_test can generate a null distribution from the output of hypervolume_permute, hypervolume_resample with method = "bootstrap", or a vector of two bootstrap outputs. See examples for how to use each case.
</p>
<p>path should point to hypervolumes generated from the two input hypervolumes. There are three valid choices:
</p>
<p>path is generated from <code>hypervolume_permute(&lt;name&gt;, hv1, hv2, ...)</code>. In this case the null distribution is generated by taking the overlap statistics of every single pair of permutations and turning them into a histogram.
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>path is generated by resampling the hypervolume generated by combining the data of hv1 and hv2
If the number of data points used to generate hv1 is the same as hv2 then the path is <code>hypervolume_resample(&lt;name&gt;, hv_combined, "bootstrap", points_per_resample = nrow(hv1@Data))</code>. In this case, the list bootstrapped hypervolumes is split in half and overlap statistics are taken for every possible pair of hypervolumes from the two halves. A histogram of these overlap statitics represent the null distribution.
</p>
<p>If the number of data points is different between hv1 and hv2 path is a list of two paths generated from <code>hypervolume_resample(&lt;name&gt;, hv_combined, "bootstrap", points_per_resample = nrow(hv1@Data), ...)</code> and <code>hypervolume_resample(&lt;name&gt;, hv_combined, "bootstrap", points_per_resample = nrow(hv2@Data), ...)</code>. Overlap statistics are taken for every possible pair of hypervolumes from each bootstrap. A histogram of these overlap statitics represent the null distribution.
See example for appropriate path inputs. 
</p>
<p>The four overlap statistics are Sorensen, Jaccard, frac_unique_1, frac_unique_2. See <code>hypervolume_overlap_statistics</code> for description of the statistics.
