<h2>Synthetic dataset used in section 5.1.3 of the reference paper</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset used for testing clustering with HMM-VB.
The data dimension is 40. The first 10 dimensions were generated from a 3-component Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). The remaining 30 dimensions were generated from a 5-component GMM. By specific design
of the means, covariance matrices and transition probabilities, the data contain 5 distinct clusters. 
For details see the references.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1000 rows and 40 variables. Last column contains ground truth cluster labels.
