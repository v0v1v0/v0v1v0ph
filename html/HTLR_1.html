<h2>Bayesian Logistic Regression with Heavy-Tailed Priors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Efficient Bayesian multinomial logistic regression based on heavy-tailed priors. 
This package is suitable for classification and feature selection with high-dimensional 
features, such as gene expression profiles. Heavy-tailed priors can impose stronger 
shrinkage (compared to Gaussian and Laplace priors) to the coefficients associated with 
a large number of useless features, but still allow coefficients of a small number of 
useful features to stand out without punishment. It can also automatically make selection 
within a large number of correlated features. The posterior of coefficients and hyper-
parameters is sampled with restricted Gibbs sampling for leveraging high-dimensionality 
and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for handling high-correlations among coefficients.
