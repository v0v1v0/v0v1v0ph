<h2>
Long-format longitudinal data for the ORX study
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Long-format measurements of PSA over the intervention period in the ORX study. Notice that this data.frame
is in suitable format for mixed-effects modeling, where each row should correspond to a single
longitudinal measurement. These measurements are annotated using the individual indicator fields 'ID',
time fields 'Day', 'TrDay', 'Date', and the response values are contained in raw format in 'PSA' or
after log2-transformation in 'log2PSA'. Additional fields are provided for group testing and matched 
inference in 'Group', 'Submatch', and the binary indicators 'ORX+Tx', 'ORX', and 'Intact'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("orxlong")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 392 observations on the following 11 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ID</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique character indicator for the different individual(s)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PSA</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Raw longitudinal PSA measurement values in unit (ug/l)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>log2PSA</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Log2-transformed longitudinal PSA measurement values in unit (log2 ug/l)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Day</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Day since the first PSA measurement. Notice that there is a single time point prior to interventions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TrDay</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Day since the interventions began, 0 annotating the point at which surgery was performed or drug compounds were first given.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Date</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A date format when the actual measurement was performed</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Group</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The actual intervention groups, after blinded groups were assigned to 'ORX+Tx', 'ORX', or 'Intact'</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Submatch</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The submatches that were assigned based on the baseline variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<span class="samp">⁠ORXTx⁠</span>’</dt>
<dd>
<p>A binary indicator field indicating which measurements belong to the group 'ORX+Tx'</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ORX</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A binary indicator field indicating which measurements belong to the group 'ORX'</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Intact</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A binary indicator field indicating which measurements belong to the group 'Intact'</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For mixed-effects modeling, the fields 'ID', 'PSA' (or 'log2PSA'), 'TrDay', and group-specific indicators should be included.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Group-testing should be performed so that 'ORX+Tx' is tested against 'ORX', in order to infer possible effects 
occurring due to 'Tx' on top of 'ORX'. 'ORX' should be compared to 'Intact', in order to infer if the 'ORX' surgical
procedure has beneficial effects in comparison to intact animals. For statistical modeling of the intervention effects,
one should use observations with the positive 'TrDay'-values, as this indicates the beginning of the interventions.
