<h2>Identify Sequence Differences Between Two Alleles at a Locus</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compares the sequences of two alleles at a locus, and identifies the differences between them at specific positions
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compareSequences(alignType, alleles)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alignType</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string identifying the type of alignment being searched. Allowed values are "codon","gen", nuc" and "prot". Only one 'alignType' value is permitted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alleles</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing two full-length names for alleles at the same locus.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A two-row data frame identifying the positions and sequences at which the two alleles differ. E.g., compareSequences(alignType = "gen", alleles = c("DPA1<em>01:03:38:01","DPA1</em>01:03:38:02"). Positions for which the sequence of either allele is unknown are ignored.
