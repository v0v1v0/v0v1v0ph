<h2>Seeds genrmination data set from Crowder (1978)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set was initially presented in Corder (1978) to demonstrate the problem of over dispersion with binomial response and its solution via beta-binomial ANOVA. Latter, the data set is used by may others including Breslow and Clayton (1993) and Lee and Nelder (1996) to demonstrate the usefulness of the Generalized Linear Mixed (and hierarchical) model. The seeds data set was originally obtained from a 2 by 2 factorial layout. The experiment was conducted on two types of seeds, <em>O. aegyptiaca 75</em> and <em>O. aegyptica 73</em>, and two root extracts, bean and cucumber with an equal dilution, 1/125. Experimental units (plates) were prepared with the specific roots extracts and a batch of certain seeds was brushed into the plates. The outcome is the count of germinated seed out of the total number of seeds applied in each plate.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p> The seeds data set contans 5 columns and 21 rows. A short description of the data columns are given below.
