<h2>Compute a joint p-value for a list of haplin fits (usually from a sliding window approach), correcting for multiple testing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The first argument to <code>suest</code> should be a list of haplin estimation results (from the same data file), usually the output from <code>haplinSlide</code>. <code>suest</code> produces as a result a joint overall p-value based on aggregating the individual p-values and then correcting for multiple testing. The correction is achieved by using the principle of "seemingly unrelated" estimation, taking into account the correlation between the individual estimation results. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">suest(reslist)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reslist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list whose elements are different haplin runs on the same data file, typically the output of <code>haplinSlide</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>haplinSlide</code> runs <code>haplin</code> on a series of overlapping
windows of markers from the same data file, typically within the same gene.
Since each run produces a separate overall p-value, <code>suest</code> computes a
joint overall p-value for the gene (or region) that has been scanned. It
corrects the overall p-value for multiple testing, also taking into account
the fact that the sequence of estimates produced by <code>haplinSlide</code> will
be dependent, both because they are computed on the same data set and also
since the windows are overlapping (if the window length is larger than 1).
If the <code>suest</code> estimation fails (which doesn't happen very often), a
standard Bonferroni correction is used instead. Important:
<code>haplinSlide</code> must be run with the option <code>table.output = FALSE</code>
to provide <code>suest</code> with enough information.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list is returned, the most important elements of which are:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pval.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The overall score p-values from each haplin run</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pval.obs.corr</code></td>
<td>
<p>The joint p-value, corrected for multiple testing</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bonferroni</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical, usually FALSE, which means the <code>suest</code> estimation went well. If TRUE, it means that the <code>suest</code> estimation failed for some reason, and a standard Bonferroni correction was used instead.</p>
</td>
</tr>

reference = "ref.cat", winlength = 1, table.output = F)
# Provide summary of separate results:
lapply(result.1, summary)
# Plot results:

lapply(result.1, plot)
# Compute an overall p-value for the scan, corrected for multiple testing
