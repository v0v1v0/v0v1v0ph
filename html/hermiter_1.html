<h2>Efficient Sequential and Batch Estimation of Univariate and Bivariate Probability Density Functions and Cumulative Distribution Functions along with Quantiles (Univariate) and Nonparametric Correlation (Bivariate)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Facilitates estimation of full univariate and bivariate 
  probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions along with
  full quantile functions (univariate) and nonparametric correlation 
  (bivariate) using Hermite series based estimators. These estimators are 
  particularly useful in the sequential setting (both stationary and 
  non-stationary) and one-pass batch estimation setting for large data sets. 
  Based on: Stephanou, Michael, Varughese, Melvin and Macdonald, Iain. "Sequential quantiles via Hermite series density estimation." Electronic Journal of Statistics 11.1 (2017): 570-607 &lt;doi:10.1214/17-EJS1245&gt;,

cor                     A wrapper around the stats::cor function adding
                        two additional methods, namely method =
                        "hermite.spearman" and method =
                        "hermite.kendall" (can be abbreviated). The
                        input parameters and output value semantics
                        closely match the stats::cor method for easy
                        interchange. If neither the "hermite.spearman"
                        nor the "hermite.kendall" method is selected,
