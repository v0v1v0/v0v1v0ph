<h2>Index of Disparity (unweighted) (IDISU)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Index of Disparity (IDIS) is a relative measure of inequality that
shows the average difference between each subgroup and the setting
average, in relative terms. In the unweighted version (IDISU),
all subgroups are weighted equally.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">idisu(
  pop = NULL,
  est,
  se = NULL,
  scaleval,
  setting_average = NULL,
  sim = NULL,
  seed = 123456,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of people within each subgroup.
Population size must be available for all subgroups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>est</code></td>
<td>
<p>The subgroup estimate.
Estimates must be available for all subgroups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>The standard error of the subgroup estimate.
If this is missing, 95% confidence intervals of IDISU cannot be calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaleval</code></td>
<td>
<p>The scale of the indicator. For example, the
scale of an indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The
scale of an indicator measured as a rate per 1000 population is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>setting_average</code></td>
<td>
<p>The reported setting average. Setting average must
be unique for each setting, year, indicator combination.
If population is not specified for all subgroups, the setting average is
used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of simulations to estimate 95% confidence intervals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>The random number generator (RNG) state for the 95% confidence
interval simulation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments passed to or from other methods.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>IDISU is calculated as the average of absolute differences between the
subgroup estimates and the setting average, divided by the number of
subgroups and the setting average, and multiplied by 100. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., &amp;
Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.
</p>
<p>95% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and IDISU is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
IDISU results.
</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> IDISU has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. IDISU is zero if there is no
inequality.
</p>
<p><strong>Type of summary measure:</strong> Complex; relative; non-weighted
</p>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Non-ordered; more than two subgroups
</p>
