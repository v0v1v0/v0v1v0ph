<h2> Hash/associative array/dictionary data structure for the R language. </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This S4 class is designed to provide a hash-like data structure in a  
native R style and provides the necessary methods for all general 
methods for hash operations.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

 
<p>R is slowly moving toward a native implementation of hashes 
using environments, (cf. <code>Extract</code>. Access to 
environments using $ and [[ has been available for some time and
recently objects can inherit from environments, etc. But many features
that make hashes/dictionaries great are still lacking, such
as the slice operation, [.
</p>
<p>The hash package is the only full featured hash 
implementation for the R language. It provides more features and 
finer control of the hash behavior than the native feature set and 
has similar and sometimes better performance.
</p>
<p>HASH KEYS must be a valid character value and may not be the empty 
string <code>""</code>. 
</p>
<p>HASH VALUES can be any R value, vector or object. 
</p>
<p>PASS-BY REFERENCE. Environments and hashes are special objects in R 
because only one copy exists globally. When provide as an argument to 
a function, no local copy is made and any changes to the hash in the
functions are reflected globally.
</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE.  Hashes are based on R's native environments and are 
designed to be exceedingly fast using the environments internal 
hash table.  For small data structures, a list will out-perform a hash
in nearly every case.  For larger data structure, i.e. &gt; 500 key
value pair the performance of the hash becomes faster.  Much beyond that
the performance of the hash far outperforms native lists.  
</p>
<p>MEMORY. Objects of class <code>hash</code> do not release memory with a call to 
<code>rm</code>.  <code>clear</code> must be called before <code>rm</code> to properly
release the memory.
