<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The amphibian monitoring program started in 1999 and is mainly aimed
at surveying population trends of endangered amphibian species. Every
year, about 30 water bodies in two or three randomly selected priority
areas (out of ten priority areas of high amphibian diversity) are
surveyed. Additionally, a random selection of water bodies that
potentially are suitable for one of the endangered amphibian species
but that do not belong to the priority areas were surveyed. Each water
body is surveyed by single trained volunteer during two nocturnal
visits per year. Volunteers recorded anurans by walking along the
water's edge with precise rules for the duration of a survey taking
account of the size of the surveyed water body and noting visual
encounters and calls. As fare as possible, encountered individuals of
the Pelophylax-complex were identified as Marsh Frog (Pelophylax
ridibundus), Pool Frog (P. lessonaea) or hybrids (P. esculentus) based
on morphological characteristics or based on their calls. In the given
data set, however, these three taxa are lumped together.
