<h2>Promotions of U.S. Navy officers, 1798-1849</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains records of the careers of officers of the line in the
United States Navy who became midshipmen between 1798 and 1849. It lists the
dates at which officers were promoted to the ranks of midshipment,
lieutenant, master commandament, and captain.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 5,705 observations of 4 variables.</p>


<h3>Variables</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>id</code>: A unique numeric identifier for each officer.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>name</code>: Name of the officer.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>generation</code>: A numeric value to represent a judgment about the
generations within the officer corp of the U.S. Navy. First generation
officers entered the service before 1801, as a rank higher than midshipman.
Second generation officers entered the service before the Peace
Establishment Act (or by the end of 1801), but as midshipman. Thus, they
essentially became adults in the service, and they learned their craft from
the first generation. Third generation officers entered the service as
midshipmen after the Peace Establishment Act but before the end of the War
of 1812. Those officers in this generation who became captain rose to that
rank in the 1830s and '40s. Fourth generation officers entered the service
after the War of 1812 had ended. These officers saw almost no wartime
service, and many of the ones who achieved captain found themselves having
to decide whether to serve in the Union or the Confederacy during the Civil
War.
