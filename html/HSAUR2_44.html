<h3>Details</h3>

<p>De Backer et al. (1998) describe a clinical trial to compare two competing oral antifungal 
treatments for toenail infection (dermatophyte onychomycosis). A total of 378 patients 
were randomly allocated into two treatment groups, one group receiving 250mg per 
day of terbinafine and the other group 200mg per day of itraconazole. 
Patients were evaluated at seven visits, intended to be at weeks 
0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 for the degree of separation of the nail 
plate from the nail bed (onycholysis) dichotomized into <code>moderate or severe</code> 
and <code>none or mild</code>. But patients did not always arrive exactly at the 
scheduled time and the exact time in months that they did attend was recorded. 
The data is not balanced since not all patients attended for all seven planned 
visits.
