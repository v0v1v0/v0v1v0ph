<h2>Multiple sclerosis lesion counts for three patients.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lesion counts for three multiple sclerosis patients.
The counts were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging,
and were observed at monthly intervals.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  lesionCount
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with three components each component being the sequence
of counts for a given patient and consisting of a vector with
non-negative integer entries.
</p>


<h3>Modelling</h3>

<p>The hidden Markov models applied to these data by Albert et al.
and by MacKay and Petkau were much more complex and elaborate than
those fitted in the examples in this package.  See the references
for details.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data were originally studied by Albert et al., (1994).
They are were also analyzed by Altman and Petkau (2005).
The data were kindly provided by Prof. Altman.
