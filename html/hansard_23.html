<h2>All answered parliamentary questions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Imports data on all answered parliamentary questions in the
House of Commons and/or in the House of Lords. The <code>mp_id</code>,
<code>tabling_mp_id</code> and <code>answering_body</code> parameters accept a single
ID or department names, or a list of IDs or department names, respectively.
</p>
<p>This is the most flexible of the various functions that look
up questions, as it queries all types of questions in both houses with a
wide selection of parameters: The member who asks the question, the member
who answers it and the relevant department can all be used to query the API.
<code>mp_id</code>, <code>tabling_mp_id</code> and <code>answering_body</code> all accept
lists of multiple relevant search parameters. This can be in the form of a
list, a data.frame column, a character vector, etc.
</p>
