<h2>Example data for informative cluster size</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated hypothetical clustered data created for illustration of functions in the <code>htestClust</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(screen8)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2224 rows and 12 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>sch.id</dt>
<dd>
<p>identification variable for school (clusters).</p>
</dd>
<dt>stud.id</dt>
<dd>
<p>identification variable for students within schools (observations within clusters).</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>student age in years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gender</dt>
<dd>
<p>binary student gender.</p>
</dd>
<dt>height</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>student weight in lbs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>math</dt>
<dd>
<p>score from standardized math test.</p>

<dd>
<p>score from standardized reading test.</p>
</dd>
<dt>phq2</dt>

<p>age-adjusted fitness quartile from physical health assessment at end of school year.</p>
</dd>
<dt>qfit.s</dt>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Hypothetical data simulated for the following scenario.
An urban school district has collected demographic, biometric, and academic performance data
from graduating 8th grade students. <code>screen8</code> contains a sample of this data from 2224 students across
73 schools. Student-level observations are clustered within schools.
The school district has implemented an incentive program in which schools with higher participation rates are
prioritized for classroom and technology upgrades. Cluster size could be informative in this data, as resource-poor
schools might have higher participation rates (larger cluster size), but also tend to have worse health metrics and
lower standardized test scores.
