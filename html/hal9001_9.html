<h2>Enumerate Basis Functions at Generalized Edges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For degrees of smoothness greater than 1, we must generate the lower order
smoothness basis functions using the knot points at the "edge" of the
hypercube. For example, consider f(x) = x^2 + x, which is second-order
smooth, but will not be generated by purely quadratic basis functions. We
also need to include the y = x function (which corresponds to first-order
HAL basis functions at the left most value/edge of x).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">enumerate_edge_basis(
  x,
  max_degree = 3,
  smoothness_orders = rep(0, ncol(x)),
  include_zero_order = FALSE,
  include_lower_order = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An input <code>matrix</code> containing observations and covariates
following standard conventions in problems of statistical learning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>The highest order of interaction terms for which the basis
functions ought to be generated. The default (<code>NULL</code>) corresponds to
generating basis functions for the full dimensionality of the input matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>smoothness_orders</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector of length <code>ncol(x)</code>
specifying the desired smoothness of the function in each covariate. k = 0
is no smoothness (indicator basis), k = 1 is first order smoothness, and so
on. For an additive model, the component function for each covariate will
have the degree of smoothness as specified by smoothness_orders. For
non-additive components (tensor products of univariate basis functions),
the univariate basis functions in each tensor product have smoothness
degree as specified by smoothness_orders.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include_zero_order</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>logical</code>, indicating whether the zeroth
order basis functions are included for each covariate (if <code>TRUE</code>), in
addition to the smooth basis functions given by <code>smoothness_orders</code>.
This allows the algorithm to data-adaptively choose the appropriate degree
of smoothness.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include_lower_order</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>logical</code>, like <code>include_zero_order</code>,
except including all basis functions of lower smoothness degrees than
specified via <code>smoothness_orders</code>.</p>
</td>
