<h2>Sense of Agency and User Experience</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Aggregated data from an experiment where participants used three
different means of input to control a game. As established in previous work,
the three means of input vary in objective sense of agency. This study collected
subjective measures of agency, as well as subjective measures of user experiences
for comparison.

<h3>Usage</h3>
