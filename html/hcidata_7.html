<h2>Acquisition study for occluded interaction</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In this study, participants wore an AR headset and were asked to interact with 
objects occluded by a wall in front of them. They had to reach around to then
manipulate the objects. They were supported in this task by several different
kinds of visualization that showed them the object of interest. After each trial
and at the end of the study, the participants provided ratings of each visualization
as well as a ranking of the different visualizations.
