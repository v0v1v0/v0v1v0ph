<h2>Compute the adjacency matrix of a network from its edgelist</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the adjacency matrix of a network from its edgelist
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matrix_from_edgelist(
  edgelist,
  origin_name = "origin",
  target_name = "target",
  count,
  format_long = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edgelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>(data.table) A table containing the edges (or links) of the
network, i.e. representing the movements of subjects between
facilities. Either in long format with at least two columns (origin and
target facilities of a link), each row corresponding to a single
movement, or aggregated by unique pairs of origin/target, therefore with
an additional variable for movements count (default). See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>origin_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) Column of the origin facilities of the links.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) Column of the target facilities of the links.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>count</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) Column of the counts of movements by unique pair of
facilities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>format_long</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) Whether the edgelist is in long format, with
each row corresponding to a single movement. If TRUE, the edgelist will
be aggregated by unique pairs of facilities to compute the matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The edgelist contains the information on the connections between
nodes of the network, that is the movements of subjects between
facilities. The edgelist can be in two different formats: long or
aggregated. In long format, each row corresponds to a single movement
between two facilities, therefore only two columns are needed, one
containing the origin facilities of a movement, the other containing the
target facilities. In aggregated format, the edgelist is aggregated by
unique pairs of origin-target facilities. Thus, each row corresponds to a
unique connection between two facilities, and the table contains an
additional variable which is the count of the number of movements
recorded for the pair. If the edgelist is provided in long format, it
will be aggregated to compute the matrix.
