<h2>
Hypergraphs in R
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements various tools for storing and analyzing hypergraphs.
  Handles basic undirected, unweighted hypergraphs, and various ways of 
  creating hypergraphs from a number of representations, and
  converting between graphs and hypergraphs.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A hypergraph is implemented as a list containing (for now) a
single element, <code>M</code>, corresponding to the incidence matrix. 
It is an S3 object with class <code>hypergraph</code> and a plot method,
summary and print methods.
The package 
uses a sparse representation (from the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix"><span class="pkg">Matrix</span></a> package), so
in principle it should allow for very large hypergraphs, although to 
date only relatively small hypergraphs have been investigated.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A graph is a set of vertices, V, and a set of egdes, E, 
each of which contains two
vertices (or a single vertex, if self-loops are allowed). A hypergraph is
a generalization of this, in which more than two vertices can be in a single
hyper-edge. Multi-graphs are graphs in which E is not a set, but rather allows
for duplicate edges. Hypergraphs are allowed to have duplicate hyper-edges.
</p>
<p><img src="../help/figures/h.png" width="200" alt=""></p>
<p>This package is a simple implementation of hypergraphs built around the
incidence matrix – a binary matrix in which the rows correspond to 
the hyper-edges, the columns to vertices, and a 1 in position (i,j) indicates 
that the vertex j is in the ith hyper-edge. There is currently no support
for directed or weighted hypergraphs.
</p>
<p>Various methods of manipulating hypergraphs, such as
adding and removing edges and vertices are implemented, and for small 
hypergraphs the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph"><span class="pkg">igraph</span></a> package plot routine is used to plot
the hypergraph and its hyper-edges. For hypergraphs with more than a few
dozen vertices, it is recommended that the <code>plot</code> function be
called with <code>mark.groups=NULL</code>. See <code>igraph.plotting</code>
for more information.
</p>
<p>There are utilities in this package for removing loops, duplicate hyper-edges,
empty hyper-edges, and isolated vertices (ones that are not contained in
any hyper-edge). Also, there is a function, <code>reduce.hypergraph</code>, which
reduces the hypergraph down to its largest hyper-edges – that is, it
removes hyper-edges that are subsets of other hyper-edges. It also
has other ways to reduce the hypergraph, see the corresponding manual
page.
</p>
<p>There are also utilities for extracting information from the hypergraph.
For example, simple statistics such as the number of vertices, hyper-edges,
degrees of vertices, number of nodes per hyper-edge. Also global properties
such as
whether it is connected, if it has the Helly property or is conformal (see the
manual pages for <code>has.helly</code> and <code>is.conformal</code> for more information
on these topics).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some effort has been taken to avoid masking or redefining
functions from the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph"><span class="pkg">igraph</span></a> package. While this results in awkward
function names ("hypergraph" nearly everywhere) it does reduce the chances
of hard-to-diagnose errors. I am considering adding aliases that 
replace "hypergraph" with "hg" or some such, but I'm not sure this is helpful.
The two functions that are masked, <code>is.simple</code> and <code>line.graph</code>,
first check whether their argument is an <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph"><span class="pkg">igraph</span></a> graph, and if so
calls the corresponding <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph"><span class="pkg">igraph</span></a> function.
