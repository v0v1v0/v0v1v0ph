<h2>Hopkins statistics for clustering tendency</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate Hopkins statistic for given data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hopkins(
  X,
  m = ceiling(nrow(X)/10),
  d = ncol(X),
  k = 1,
  U = NULL,
  method = "simple"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data (matrix or data.frame) to check clusterability.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of rows to sample from X. Default is 1/10th the number of rows of X.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dimension of the data (number of columns of X).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>kth nearest neighbor to find.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>U</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data containing <code>m</code> uniformly-sampled points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either "simple" or "torus".</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Calculated values 0-0.3 indicate regularly-spaced data.
Values around 0.5 indicate random data.
Values 0.7-1 indicate clustered data.
</p>
<p>CAUTION: This function does NOT center and scale the columns of X.
You may need to do this manually before using this function.
</p>
<p>You should NOT set The parameter 'd'. It is included here to allow for
comparisons of <code>hopkins::hopkins()</code> and <code>clustertend::hopkins()</code>.
</p>
<p>The data <code>U</code> is also not normally set by the user.  It is included
here to allow for unit testing and also for customization of the
uniformly-sampled points (e.g. enlarged by 5 percent as suggested by
some authors).
</p>
<p>Some authors suggest sampling less than 10 percent of points.
Others suggest m&gt;10 points to avoid small-sample problems.
The distribution of Hopkins statistic requires that nearest neighbors
to the selected points be mutually independent, so that only a few of
the points can be marked.  The distribution of Hopkins statistic is
Beta(m,m), independent of the dimensionality of the data d.
</p>
<p>Cross &amp; Jain say "The m sampling points are few enough in number,
relative to n (the number of events), that their presence does not
materially affect  the overall density.  Ratios of at least 10 to 1
and preferably 20 to 1 are used in the literature.
On the other hand, it seems that m should be at least 10 in order
to avoid any small sample problems with the distributions of the
statistics.  This effectively  limits the methods to problems with
at least 100 events.  In high dimensions, very little can be said
about data sets that are sparser than that."

<p>Note:
</p>
<p>Comparison of <code>hopkins::hopkins()</code> and <code>clustertend::hopkins()</code>.
</p>
<p>The 'hopkins::hopkins()' function uses distances^d (where "distance"
is the Euclidean distance between points and "d" is the number of
columns in the data).
The value returned is: Hopkins statistic.
</p>
<p>The 'clustertend::hopkins()' function uses distances^1.
The value returned is: 1 - Hopkins statistic.
</p>
