<h2>Simulation of genetic data in Haplin format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulates genetic data in Haplin format, consisting of fetal effects, maternal effects and/or parent-of-origin effects. 
Allows for simulation of both autosomal and X-linked markers, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Enables stratified simulations for gene-environment interaction analyses, i.e the input (relative risks, number of cases etc) may vary across different strata.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

RR, RRcm, RRcf, RRstar, RR.mat, RRstar.mat, 
gen.missing.cases = NULL, gen.missing.controls = NULL,
n.sim = 1000, xchrom = F, sim.comb.sex = "double", BR.girls, dire = "simfiles",

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>hapSim</code> simulates allele values for case and control families at multiple markers (typically in LD) simultaneously. The number of markers/SNPs involved will typically be in the range 1 to 6. Data are simulated to produce relative risks of disease as specified by the user input. Simulations can be performed separately over a number of strata so as to simulate gene-environment interactions.
</p>
<p>Specifying haplotype risks:<br>
The number of haplotypes used in the simulations is determined by the <code>nall</code> argument, since <code>prod(nall)</code> different haplotypes can be made from the specified number of markers, <code>length(nall)</code>. The arguments <code>haplo.freq</code>, <code>RR</code>, <code>RRcm</code>, <code>RRcf</code>, <code>RRstar</code>, <code>RR.mat</code>, and <code>RRstar.mat</code> are all lists where each element represents a stratum. Within each stratum, the arguments are vectors of length equal to the number of haplotypes, specifying the relative risk etc. associated with each haplotype.
The stratum specific arguments may be simplified if the number of strata is one, or if the arguments are equal across all strata.
</p>
<p>The haplotypes are determined by creating all possible haplotypes from the given markers, in a sequence where the first marker varies mostly quickly. For instance, if <code>nall = c(3,2)</code>, the first marker has 3 alleles, the second has 2, and 6 haplotypes are possible. Taken in order, the haplotypes are 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 1-2, 2-2, and 3-2. When specifying, say, <code>RR = c(1,2,1,1,1,1)</code> the haplotype 2-1 has a double risk compared to the rest. With, for instance, two strata, the specification <code>RR = list(c(1,2,1,1,1,1), c(1,1,1,1,1,1))</code> would mean that the risk associated with 2-1 is elevated only in the first stratum, not the second. 
</p>
<p>The simplest example would be with <code>nall = c(2)</code> and <code>RR = c(1,2)</code>, which would simulate a single SNP where the second allele has a double risk.
</p>
<p>Output file format:<br>
The format of the simulated files is relatively flexible and allows multi-allelic markers and various designs.
If both case and control families are present, the simulated files contain a leading column of the case/control status (1/0). 
If <code>xchrom=TRUE</code>, the neighboring column to the left of the genetic data contains the sex information (1 = male, 2 = female). 
Each line represents genotypes for a case or control triad. 
</p>
<p>There are six columns for each locus, two for the mother (M), two for the father (F) and two for the child (C). The columns are placed in the following sequence: M11 M12 F11 F12 C11 C12 M21 M22 F21 F22 C21 C22... etc, 
where the first number indicates marker, and the second number indicates the first or second allele at this locus. Columns are separated by a single white space, and missing data are coded as NA.
</p>
<p>Intermediate designs, for instance mother-child dyads, are represented as full triads with columns of absent family members set to missing. In the case of a pure case-control design, however, each line represents a single individual, and there are no columns representing mothers and fathers.<br></p>
<p>There are no row or column names in the files.
</p>
<p>Some examples are given below. See <a href="https://haplin.bitbucket.io/docu/haplin_data_format.html">https://haplin.bitbucket.io/docu/haplin_data_format.html</a> for a thorough description of the Haplin format. Note that this description separates the two alleles for an individual within a locus by a semi-colon, such as 1;2. This is, however, not necessary.<br>
Confer the document <a href="https://haplin.bitbucket.io/docu/Haplin_power.pdf">https://haplin.bitbucket.io/docu/Haplin_power.pdf</a> for details and examples on how to perform the simulations.
</p>
<p><code>gen.missing.cases</code> and <code>gen.missing.controls</code> are flexible arguments. By default, both equal NULL, which means that no missing data are generated at random.
If the arguments are single numbers, missing data are generated at random with this proportion for all cases and/or controls. 
If the arguments are vectors of length equal to the number of loci, missing data are generated with the corresponding proportion for each locus.
The arguments can also be matrices with the number of rows equal to the number of loci and three columns. 
Each row corresponds to a locus, and the columns correspond to mothers, fathers and children, respectively.</p>
