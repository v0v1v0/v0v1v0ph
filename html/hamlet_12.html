<h2>
Transform a matching vector to a binary matching matrix
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows transforming a matching vector to a binary matching matrix. A matching vector is of length N where each element indicates the submatch to which the observation belongs to. Notice that this is not the same as the group allocation vector that is provided by the match.allocate-function. The binary matching matrix is of size N x N where 0 indicates that the observations have been part of a different submatch, and 1 indicates that the observations have been part of the same submatch. Diagonal is always 0 although an observation is always in the same submatch with its self.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">match.vec2mat(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matching vector 'x'
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>N times N binary matching matrix, where 0 indicates that the observations have been part of a different submatch, and 1 indicates that the observations have been part of the same submatch.</p>
