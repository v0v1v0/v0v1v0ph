<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data come from a small region including 476 one minute by
one minute grid cells. This region is is a small corner of South
Africa's Cape Floristic Region, and includes very high plant species
diversity and a World Biosphere Reserve. The data frame can be used as
an example for several functions in the <code>hSDM</code> package.</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>neighbors.Latimer2006</code> is a vector of 3542 integers indicating
the neighbors (adjacent cells) of each spatial cell. The vector is of
the form c(neighbors of cell 1, neighbors of cell 2, ... , neighbors
of the last cell).
