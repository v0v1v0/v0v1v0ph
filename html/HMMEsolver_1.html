<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Consider the linear mixed model with normal random effects,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">Y = X\beta + Zv + \epsilon</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\beta</code> and <code class="reqn">v</code> are vectors of fixed and random effects.
One of most popular methods to solve the Henderson's Mixed Model Equation
related to the problem is EM-type algorithm. Its drawback, however, comes from
repetitive matrix inversion during recursive estimation steps. Kim (2017) proposed
a novel method of avoiding such difficulty, letting the estimation more fast, stable, and
scalable.
