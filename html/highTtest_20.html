<h2>
Simultaneous critical values for t-tests in very high dimensions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011) for the significance 
analysis of thousands of features in high-dimensional biological studies. 
It is an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure to find critical values 
for rejection regions controlling the k-familywise error rate, false discovery 
rate, and the tail probability of false discovery proportion.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">highTtest(dataSet1, dataSet2, gammas, compare = "BOTH", cSequence = NULL, 
tSequence = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataSet1 </code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame or matrix containing the dataset for subset 1
for the two-sample t-test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataSet2 </code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame or matrix containing the dataset for subset 2
for the two-sample t-test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gammas   </code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of significance levels at which feature 
significance is to be determined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compare  </code></td>
<td>
<p>one of ("ST", "BH", "Both", "None"). 
In addition to the Cao-Kosorok method, 
obtain feature significance indicators using
the Storey-Tibshirani method (ST) 
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003),
the Benjamini-Hochberg method (BH), 
(Benjamini andHochberg, 1995),
"both" the ST and the BH methods, or 
do not consider alternative methods (none).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cSequence</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying the values of c to be considered
in estimating the proportion of alternative hypotheses. 
If no vector is provided, a default of 
seq(0.01,6,0.01) is used. See Section 2.3 of
Cao and Kosorok (2011) for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tSequence</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector specifying the search space for the critical 
t value. If no vector is provided, a default of 
seq(0.01,6,0.01) is used.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Storey-Tibshirani (2003), ST, method implemented in <span class="pkg">highTtest</span> is
adapted from the implementation written by Alan Dabney and John D. Storey and 
available from 
</p>
<p>http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qvalue.html. 
</p>
<p>The comparison capability is included only for convenience and reproducibility 
of the original manuscript. For a complete analysis based on the ST method, 
the user is referred to the <span class="pkg">qvalue</span> package available through the
bioconductor archive.
</p>
<p>The following methods retrieve individual results from a highTtest
object, x: 
</p>
<p><code>BH(x)</code>: 
Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
was determined to be significant by the Benjamini-Hochberg
(1995) method.
</p>
<p><code>CK(x)</code>: 
Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
was determined to be significant by the Cao-Kosorok
(2011) method.
</p>
<p><code>pi_alt(x)</code>: Retrieves the
estimated proportion of alternative hypotheses
obtained by the Cao-Kosorok (2011) method. 
</p>
<p><code>pvalue(x)</code>: Retrieves the
vector of p-values calculated using the
two-sample t-statistic. 
</p>
<p><code>ST(x)</code>:  
Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
was determined to be significant by the Storey-Tibshirani
(2003) method. 
</p>
<p>A simple x-y plot comparing the number of significant
features as a function of the level significance level
can be generated using
</p>
<p><code>plot(x,...)</code>: Generates a plot
of the number of significant features as a function of the
level of significance as calculated for each method (CK,BH, and/or
ST). Additional plot controls can be passed through the ellipsis.
</p>
<p>When comparisons to the ST and BH methods are requested, Venn diagrams
can be generated using provided that package colorfulVennPlot is
installed.
</p>
<p><code>vennD(x, gamma, ...)</code>: Generates 
two- and three-dimensional Venn diagrams comparing the
features selected by each method. Implements methods of
package <span class="pkg">colorfulVennPlot</span>. In addition to the <code>highTtest</code>
object, the level of significance, <code>gamma</code>, must
also be provided. Most control argument of the
<span class="pkg">colorfulVennPlot</span> package can be passed through the ellipsis.
</p>
