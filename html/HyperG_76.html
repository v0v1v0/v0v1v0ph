Remove redundant hyperedges and isolated vertices.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reduce a hypergraph by removing redundant edges, loops, or isolated vertices.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reduce.hypergraph(h,method="inclusion")
simplify.hypergraph(h)
remove.isolates(h)
remove.loops(h)
remove.empty.hyperedges(h)
remove.loops(h)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>h</code></td>
<td>

<p>a hypergraph
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>reduce.hypergraph</code> removes redundant edges and/or reduces the hyper-edges:
if the method is
"inclusion" this removes hyper-edges that
are contained in other hyper-edges;
if the method is "intersection", it replaces the hypergraph with a new hypergraph
whose edges are intersections of the original hypergraph's hyper-edges â€“ each pair of hyper-edges e1 and e2 with a non-empty intersection result in a hyper-edge
corresponding to that intersection in the new hypergraph;
if the method is "union" it removes edges that are contained in the union
of the other edges, reducing to a hypegraph in which every hyper-edge contains
at least one vertex which is contained in no other hyper-edge. 
</p>
<p>Isolates are vertices that are not in any
hyper-edges, and loops are hyper-edges containing a single vertex.
<code>reduce.hypergraph</code> will remove edges which contain no vertices, since the
null set is a subset of any hyper-edge and hence is in the union of all other
hyper-edges, so for either method such edges would be removed.
<code>simplify.hypergraph</code> removes loops, isolates, and empty hyper-edges
from a hypergraph. Isolates are removed after removing loops.
This may reduce the order of the hypergraph, unlike the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph"><span class="pkg">igraph</span></a>
<code>simplify</code> command, which only removes edges.
