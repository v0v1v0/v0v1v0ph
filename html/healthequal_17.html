<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains sample data for computing non-ordered summary measures
of health inequality. It contains data from a household survey for two
indicators, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel
and under-five mortality rate, disaggregated by subnational region.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated
as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel divided by the
total number of live births to women aged 15-49 years occurring in the
period prior to the survey.
</p>
<p>Skilled health personnel include doctors, nurses, midwives and other
medically trained personnel, as defined according to each country. This is
in line with the definition used by the Countdown to 2030 Collaboration,
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
(MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS).
</p>
<p>The under-five mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per
1000 live births) of a child born in a specific year or period dying before
reaching the age of five years. It is calculated as the number of deaths at
age 0-5 years divided by the number of surviving children at the beginning
of the specified age range during the 10 years prior to the survey.
</p>
<p>Subnational regions are defined using country-specific criteria. Subnational
region is a non-ordered dimension (meaning that the subgroups do not have
an inherent ordering).
</p>
<p>This dataset can be used to calculate non-ordered summary measures of health
inequality, including: between-group variance (BGV), between-group standard
deviation (BGSD), coefficient of variation (COV), mean difference from mean
(MDM), index of disparity (IDIS), Theil index (TI) and mean log deviation
(MLD). It can also be used to calculate the impact measures population
attributable risk (PAR) and population attributable fraction (PAF).
