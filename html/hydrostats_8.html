<h2>
Calculate average timing of events (doy)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the timing of annual events. Given a dataframe consisting of years in column one and a day of year (0-365 [366 for leap years]) in column two, day.dist returns the mean day of the year (doy) and standard deviation of days around the mean. 
</p>
<p>Circular statistics are used to account for the proximity of days close to the start and the end of the year (i.e. numbers close to 0 and 365), which would notionally have a mean of approximiately 182 (see Bayliss and Jones (1993)). The mean that is returned can be interpreted as a calendar day, and data that are strongly directional will have a standard deviation close to zero.
