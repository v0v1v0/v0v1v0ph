<h2>Property based testing in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hedgehog is a modern property based testing
system in the spirit of QuickCheck, originally written in Haskell,
but now also available in R.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Software testing is critical when we want to distribute our
work, but unit testing only covers examples we have thought of.
</p>
<p>With hedgehog (integrated into testthat), we can instead test properties
which our programs and functions should have, and allow automatic
generation of tests, which cover more that we could imagine.
</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Hedgehog is
integrated shrinking of counterexamples, which allows one to quickly
find the cause of bugs, given salient examples when incorrect
behaviour occurs.
</p>


<h3>Options</h3>

<p>- 'hedgehog.tests': Number of tests to run in each property
(Default: '100').
</p>
<p>- 'hedgehog.size': Maximum size parameter to pass to generators
(Default: '50').
</p>
<p>- 'hedgehog.shrinks': Maximum number of shrinks to search for
(Default: '100').
</p>
<p>- 'hedgehog.discards': Maximum number of discards permitted
within a property test before failure
(Default: '100').
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(hedgehog)
test_that( "Reverse and concatenate symmetry",
  forall( list( as = gen.c( gen.element(1:100) )
              , bs = gen.c( gen.element(1:100) ))
        , function( as, bs )
            expect_identical ( rev(c(as, bs)), c(rev(bs), rev(as)))
  )
)
</code></pre>
