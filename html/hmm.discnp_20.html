<h2>
Fitted values of a discrete non-parametric hidden Markov
model.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the fitted values of a discrete non-parametric hidden
Markov model.  If the data are numeric these are the conditional
expectations of the observations, given the entire observation
sequence (and the estimated parameters of the model).  If the data
are categorical (whence “expectations” make no sense) the
“fitted values” are taken to be the probabilities of
each of the possible values of the observations, at each time
point.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'hmm.discnp'
fitted(object, warn=TRUE, drop=TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>An object of class <code>hmm.discnp</code> as returned by
<code>hmm()</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical scalar.  See the help for <code>sp()</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical scalar.  If there is a single sequence of observations
(i.e. if <code>object[["y"]]</code> consists of a matrix or a list of
length 1) and if <code>drop</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the returned value
is a single entity (matrix, list of two matrices, or 3-dimensional
array, depending on circumstances.  Otherwise the returned value
is a list of such entities, one for each observation sequence.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The observation sequence(s) must be present in <code>object</code> (which
will be the case if <code>object</code> was returned by <code>hmm()</code>
and if the argument <code>keep.y</code> was set to <code>TRUE</code>).
If it is not present an error is thrown.
</p>
<p>However, if such an error is thrown, do not despair!  You
<em>do not</em> have to start from scratch when fitting your
model with <code>keep.y==TRUE</code>.  If <code>fit</code> is your fitted
model that you obtained <em>without</em> setting <code>keep.y==TRUE</code>,
then you can just re-fit the model using <code>fit</code> as the
starting values: </p>
<pre>
      fit2 &lt;- hmm(&lt;whatever&gt;,par0=fit,keep.y=TRUE)
  </pre>
<p>This will of course converge instantaneously.  You could also do:
</p>
<pre>
      fit2 &lt;- update(fit,data=&lt;whatever&gt;,keep.y=TRUE)
  </pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the observations consist of a single sequence and if
<code>drop</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the returned value consists
of a single object (matrix, list of two matrices, or 3-dimensional
array, depending on circumstances; see below).  Otherwise the
returned value is a list of such objects, one for each observation
sequence.
</p>
<p>If the observations are numeric then the object corresponding
to each observation sequence is a matrix.  If the model is
univariate (see <code>hmm()</code>) then matrix has a single
column constituting the sequence of fitted values corresponding to
the observations in the given sequence.  The number of rows is the
number of observations and the entry in row <code>t</code> is the fitted
value (conditional expection) corresponding to the observation made
at time <code>t</code>. If the model is bivariate (either independent
or dependent) then the matrix has two columns corresponding
respectively to the two variables in the bivariate model.
</p>
<p>If the observations are categorical then the nature of the object
returned changes substantially depending on whether the data are
univariate, bivariate independent or bivariate dependent.  (See
<code>hmm()</code>.
</p>
<p>In the unvariate case the object corresponding to each sequence
is a matrix, the number of rows of which is the number of
observations and the number of columns of which is the number of
unique <em>possible</em> values of the observations. The entry of
this matrix in row <code>t</code> and column <code>j</code> is the conditional
probability that an emission, at time <code>t</code>, is equal to
<code class="reqn">u_i</code> where <code class="reqn">u_1, \dots, u_m</code>
are the unique possible values.
</p>
<p>In the bivariate independent case the object is a <em>list</em>
of two matrices, each of which is of the same nature as that
produced in the univariate case, corresponding respectively to
the first and second of the two variables.
</p>
<p>In the bivariate dependent case the object is a 3-dimensional
array of dimension <code class="reqn">m_1 \times m_2 \times n</code>
where <code class="reqn">m_1</code> is the number of unique possible values
of the first variable, <code class="reqn">m_2</code> is the number of unique
possible values of the second variable, and <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number
of observations.  The <code>(i,j,t)-th</code> entry of this array is
the conditional probability that an emission, at time <code>t</code>,
is equal to <code class="reqn">(u_i,v_j)</code> where the <code class="reqn">u_i</code>
are the unique possible values of the first variable and the
<code class="reqn">v_j</code> are the unique possible values of the second
variable.
