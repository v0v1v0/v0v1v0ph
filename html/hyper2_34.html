<h2>Carcinoma dataset discussed by Agresti</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset considered by Agresti.  Seven clinicians are
asked whether they see evidence for carcinoma on different patients.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(carcinoma)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>hyper2</code> object that gives a likelihood function</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Object <code>carcinoma_table</code> is drawn from Agresti.  The first seven
columns correspond to the seven clinicians A-G, the next is the count
of observations, and the remaining columns are fitted values according
to different models discussed by Agresti.
</p>
<p>Object <code>carcinoma</code> is a likelihood function (of class <code>lsl</code>)
on the Bradley-Terry strengths of the seven clinicians.  The
clinicians diagnosed the presence or absence of carcinoma on a total
of 118 patients in a blind rating scheme.  The maximum likelihood
estimator for the clinicicans' Bradley-Terry strengths is given as
<code>carcinoma_maxp</code>, which is computationally expensive to find.
The package also includes <code>carcinoma_count</code>, which is a different
estimator for the Clinicians' BT strengths.
</p>
<p>These objects can be generated by running script <code>inst/carcinoma.Rmd</code>,
which includes some further discussion and technical documentation, and
creates file <code>carcinoma.rda</code> which resides in the <code>data/</code>
directory.
