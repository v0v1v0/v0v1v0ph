<h2>Cluster Template with 40 Clusters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A cluster template created by 'handwriter' with K=40
clusters. This template was created from 100 handwriting samples from the
CSAFE Handwriting Database. This template is suitable for casework.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">templateK40
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing the contents of the cluster template.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>centers_seed</dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer for the random number generator use to select the
starting cluster centers for the K-Means algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cluster</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of cluster assignments
for each graph used to create the cluster template. The clusters are numbered sequentially 1, 2,...,K.</p>
</dd>
<dt>centers</dt>
<dd>
<p>The final cluster centers produced by the K-Means algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>K</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of clusters in the template.</p>
</dd>
<dt>n</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of training graphs to used to create the template.</p>
</dd>
<dt>docnames</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector that lists the training document from which each graph originated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>writers</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector that lists the writer of each graph.</p>
</dd>
<dt>iters</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of iterations for the K-means
algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>changes</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of the number of graphs that
changed clusters on each iteration of the K-means algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>outlierCutoff</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of the outlier cutoff values calculated on
each iteration of the K-means algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stop_reason</dt>
<dd>
<p>The reason the
K-means algorithm terminated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>wcd</dt>
<dd>
<p>The within cluster
distances on the final iteration of the K-means algorithm. More specifically,
the distance between each graph and the center of the cluster to which it
was assigned  on each iteration. The output of 'handwriter::make_clustering_template' stores
the within cluster distances on each iteration, but the previous iterations were removed here to reduce the file size.</p>
</dd>
<dt>wcss</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector of the
within-cluster sum of squares on each iteration of the K-means algorithm.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>'handwriter' splits handwriting samples into component shapes
called <em>graphs</em>. The graphs are sorted into 40 clusters with a K-Means
algorithm. See 'handwriter' for more details.
