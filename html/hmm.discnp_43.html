<h2>
Canadian hydrological data sets.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Five data sets obtained from the “HYDAT” database,
Environment and Climate Change Canada's database of historical
hydrometric data.  The data were obtained using the <code>tidyhydat</code>
package.  The data have been trimmed so that there are no gaps in
the observation dates and are presented in “raw” form and in
discretised form as deciles of the residuals (difference between
raw values and the daily mean over years).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">    data("linLandFlows")
    data("ftLiardFlows")
    data("portMannFlows")
    data("portMannSedLoads")
    data("portMannSedCon")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frames with observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Date</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Dates on which observations were made.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Value</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric vector of observation values.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mean</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The mean over years of <code>Value</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>resid</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The difference <code>Value - mean</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>deciles</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with levels <code>d1</code>, ..., <code>d10</code>,
which are the deciles of the variable <code>resid</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variable <code>mean</code> was calculated as follows:
</p>
<pre>
        yday &lt;- as.POSIXlt(X$Date)$yday
        mn   &lt;- tapply(X$Value,yday,mean,na.rm=TRUE)
        mean &lt;- mn[as.character(yday)]
   </pre>
<p>where <code>X</code> is the data set being processed.
</p>
<p>The data set <code>linLandFlows</code> originally consisted of 2008 observations;
there were 1980 observations after “trimming”.
The data set <code>ftLiardFlows</code> originally consisted of 22364 observations;
there were 11932 observations after “trimming”.
The data set <code>portMannFlows</code> originally consisted of 6455 observations;
there were 3653 observations after “trimming”.
The data set <code>portMannSedLoads</code> consists of 2771 observations;
no observations were trimmed.
The data set <code>portMannSedCon</code> consists of 4597 observations;
no observations were trimmed.
</p>
<p>The units of the “Flows” variables are cubic metres per
second (<code class="reqn">m^3/s</code>); the units of “portMannSedLoads”
are tonnes; the units of “portMannSedCon” are milligrams
per litre (mg/l).
</p>
<p>The “linLandFlows” data were obtained at the Lindberg
Landing hydrometric station on the Liard River in the Northwest
Territories of Canada.  The “ftLiardFlows” data were
obtained at the Fort Liard hydrometric station on the Liard River
in the Northwest Territories of Canada.  The “portMann”
data were obtained at the hydrometric station located at the
Port Mann pumping station on the Fraser River in the Province
of British Columbia in Canada.
