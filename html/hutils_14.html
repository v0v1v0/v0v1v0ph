<h2>AUC</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the area under the curve ("AUC") of a receiver-operating characteristic curve for the given predicted and actual values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">auc(actual, pred)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>actual</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical vector: <code>TRUE</code> for positive class. 
If not a logical vector, the result is interpreted as one if safe to do so,
<em>viz.</em> if <code>actual</code> contains precisely two unique values and is either a numeric vector,
an ordered factor, or the unique values are <code>FALSE</code> and <code>TRUE</code> (case-insensitively).
Anything else is an error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pred</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric (double) vector the same length as <code>actual</code> giving the predicted probability of <code>TRUE</code>. Must be a numeric vector the same length as <code>actual</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
