<h3>Details</h3>

<p>NOTE: Automated diagnostics are currently only supported for deterministic
emulators.
</p>
<p>There are a number of different characteristics that emulators might possess
that give rise to diagnostic flags. This function collects together some of those
whose resulting modifications can be automated. The tests, and consequences, are
as follows.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Structured Input Space</dt>
<dd>
<p>Looks for errors with dependence on input parameters. If
found, the emulator's correlation length is reduced (to a minimum of 1/3);</p>
</dd>
<dt>Structured Output Space</dt>
<dd>
<p>Looks for errors with dependence on output value. If
found, the training and validation data is resampled and emulators are retrained,
to try to incorporate/remove high leverage points;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Misclassification</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks agreement between emulator and simulator implausibility
classification. If they do not match, emulator uncertainty is inflated;</p>
</dd>
<dt>Comparison</dt>
<dd>
<p>Checks that the emulator predictions agree with the simulator
predictions at the validation points, allowing for expected margin of error.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the automated modifications are not sufficient to remove problems, then
offending emulators are removed from the set under consideration. Emulators in
this category should be carefully considered and their outputs analyzed: they may
require manual determination of the regression surface or additional training
points in the neightbourhood of the problematic inputs.
</p>
<p>The validation set can also be checked for suitability independent of emulator
structure: if <code>check_output = TRUE</code> then the outputs of the validation set
will be compared against targets, as well as checking the implausibility of the
points with respect to the emulators. If any outputs are consistent under- or
over-estimates, or if all points are to be ruled out as implausible, the emulators
corresponding to these outputs are removed. This option should be used with care:
such a situation could be informative for considering the model structure and
whether one should expect a match to observational data.
