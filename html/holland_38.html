<h2>Convert Holland score profiles to Holland-letter-codes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function converts a individual (person or environment) score profile consisting of six numerical score values into a Holland-letter code with length varying from 1 to 6 letters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sco2let(A, len = 3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector with Holland score values for the interest profile of length = 6.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>len</code></td>
<td>
<p>a integer with values of either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 indicating how many letters to return; default is set to <code>len = 3</code> to return a Holland three-letter code.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The numeric vector containing the score profile (see argument <code>A</code>) should have named numerical values (which is recommended for clarity). In this case, the order of the scores (e.g. <code>names(A) &lt;- c("R","I","A","S","E","C")</code> or <code>names(A) &lt;- c("C","E","S","I","A","R")</code> or any other) in the vector assigned to argument <code>A</code> does not matter. 
However, a vector with unnamed numerical values can also be used, in which case the assumption is made that the order of the Holland scores (numerical values) follows the scheme <code>names(A) &lt;- c("R","I","A","S","E","C")</code>; see examples below.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a character with the Holland-letter code (in upper case letters).
