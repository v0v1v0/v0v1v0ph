<h2>Additional Themes and Theme Components for 'ggplot2'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A compilation of extra themes and theme components for 'ggplot2' with an
emphasis on typography.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The core theme: <code>theme_ipsum</code> ("ipsum" is Latin for "precise") uses Arial Narrow
which should be installed on practically any modern system, so it's "free"-ish.
This font is condensed, has solid default kerning pairs and geometric numbers.
That's what I consider the "font trifecta" must-have for charts. An additional
quality for fonts for charts is that they have a diversity of weights. Arial
Narrow (the one on most systems, anyway) does not have said diversity but this
quality is not (IMO) a "must have".
</p>
<p>There is an option <code>hrbrthemes.loadfonts</code> which – if set to <code>TRUE</code> – will
call <code>extrafont::loadfonts()</code> to register non-core fonts with R PDF &amp; PostScript
devices. If you are running under Windows, the package calls the same function
to register non-core fonts with the Windows graphics device.
