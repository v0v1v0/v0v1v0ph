<h3>Details</h3>

<p>E-sports are a form of competition using video games.  E-sports are
becoming increasingly popular, with high-profile tournaments attracting
over 400 million viewers, and prize pools exceeding US$20m.
</p>
<p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS-GO) is a multiplayer first-person
shooter game in which two teams of five compete in an immersive virtual
reality combat environment.  CS-GO is distinguished by the ability to
download detailed gamefiles in which every aspect of an entire match is
recorded, it being possible to replay the match at will.
</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of such gamefiles is extremely difficult, primarily
due to complex gameplay features such as cooperative teamwork,
within-team communication, and real-time strategic fluidity.
</p>
<p>It is the task of the statistician to make robust inferences from such
complex datasets, and here I discuss data from an influential match
between “FaZe Clan” and “Cloud9”, two of the most
successful E-sports syndicates of all time, when they competed at Boston
2018.
</p>
<p>Dataset <code>counterstrike</code> is a loglikelihood function for the
strengths of ten counterstrike players; <code>counterstrike_maxp</code> is a
precomputed evaluate, and <code>zacslist</code> the observations used to
calculate the loglikelihood function.
</p>
<p>The probability model is similar to that of <code>NBA</code>: when a player
kills (scores), this is taken to be a success of the whole team rather
than the shooter.
</p>
<p>File <code>inst/counterstrike.R</code> and <code>inst/counterstrike_random.R</code>
include some further randomisation tests and discussion.
</p>
<p>The objects documented here can be generated by running script
<code>inst/counterstrike.Rmd</code>, which includes some further discussion
and technical documentation and creates file <code>counterstrike.rda</code>
which resides in the <code>data/</code> directory.
</p>
