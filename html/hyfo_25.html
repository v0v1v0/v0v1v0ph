<h2>Get bias factor for multi/operational/real time bias correction.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When you do multi/operational/real time bias correction. It's too expensive
to input hindcast and obs every time. Especially when you have a long period of hindcast
and obs, but only a short period of frc, it's too unecessary to read and compute hindcast
and obs everytime. Therefore, biasFactor is designed. Using <code>getBiasFactor</code>, you can
get the biasFactor with hindcast and observation, then you can use <code>applyBiasFactor</code> to 
apply the biasFactor to different forecasts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getBiasFactor(
  hindcast,
  obs,
  method = "scaling",
  scaleType = "multi",
  preci = FALSE,
  prThreshold = 0,
  extrapolate = "no"
)

## S4 method for signature 'data.frame,data.frame'
getBiasFactor(
  hindcast,
  obs,
  method = "scaling",
  scaleType = "multi",
  preci = FALSE,
  prThreshold = 0,
  extrapolate = "no"
)

## S4 method for signature 'list,list'
getBiasFactor(
  hindcast,
  obs,
  method = "scaling",
  scaleType = "multi",
  preci = FALSE,
  prThreshold = 0,
  extrapolate = "no"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hindcast</code></td>
<td>
<p>a hyfo grid data output or a dataframe(time series) consists of Date column and one or more value columns, 
representing the hindcast data. This data will be used in the calibration of the forecast, so it's better to have the same date period as
observation data. Check details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a hyfo grid data output or a dataframe (time series) consists of Date column and one or more value columns, 
representing the observation data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>bias correct method, including 'delta', 'scaling'...,default method is 'scaling'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scaleType</code></td>
<td>
<p>only when the method "scaling" is chosen, scaleType will be available. Two different types
of scaling method, 'add' and 'multi', which means additive and multiplicative scaling method, default is 'multi'. More info check 
details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preci</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the precipitation is biascorrected, then you have to assign <code>preci = TRUE</code>. Since for
precipitation, some biascorrect methods may not apply to, or some methods are specially for precipitation. 
Default is FALSE, refer to details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prThreshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum value that is considered as a non-zero precipitation. Default to 1 (assuming mm).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extrapolate</code></td>
<td>
<p>When use 'eqm' method, and 'no' is set, modified frc is bounded by the range of obs.
If 'constant' is set, modified frc is not bounded by the range of obs. Default is 'no'.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Information about the method and how biasCorrect works can be found in <code>biasCorrect</code>
</p>
<p><strong>why use biasFactor</strong>
</p>
<p>As for forecasting, for daily data, there is usually no need to have
different bias factor every different day. You can calculate one bisa factor using a long
period of hindcast and obs, and apply that factor to different frc.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<p>You have 10 years of hindcast and observation. you want to do bias correction for some 
forecasting product, e.g. system 4. For system 4, each month, you will get a new forecast
about the future 6 months. So if you want to do the real time bias correction, you have to
take the 10 years of hindcast and observation data with you, and run <code>biasCorrect</code> every
time you get a new forecast. That's too expensive.
</p>
<p>For some practical use in forecasting, there isn't a so high demand for accuracy. E.g.,
Maybe for February and March, you can use the same biasFactor, no need to do the computation 
again. 
</p>
<p>It is a generic function, if in your case you need to debug, please see <code>?debug()</code> 
for how to debug S4 method.
