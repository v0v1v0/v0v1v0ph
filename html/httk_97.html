<h2>KDE bandwidths for residual variability in hematocrit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Bandwidths used for a one-dimensional kernel density estimation of the
distribution of residual errors around smoothing spline fits of hematocrit vs.
age  for NHANES respondents in each of ten combinations of sex and
race/ethnicity categories.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hct_h
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list with 10 elements, each a numeric value. Each list element
corresponds to, and is named for, one combination of NHANES sex categories
(Male and Female) and NHANES race/ethnicity categories (Mexican American,
Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Other).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each matrix is the standard deviation for a normal distribution: this is the
bandwidth to be used for a kernel density estimation (KDE) (using a normal
kernel) of the distribution of residual errors around smoothing spline fits of
hematocrit vs. age for NHANES respondents in the specified sex and
race/ethnicity category. Optimal bandwidths were pre-calculated by doing the
smoothing spline fits, getting the residuals, then calling
<code>kde</code> on the residuals (which calls <code>hpi</code> to
compute the plug-in bandwidth).
</p>
<p>Used by HTTK-Pop only in "virtual individuals" mode (i.e.
<code>httkpop_generate</code> with <code>method = "v"</code>), in
<code>estimate_hematocrit</code>.
