<h2>Records of missions held by the Paulist Fathers, 1851â€“1893</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains transcriptions of records of missions held in  by the
Paulist Fathers, a Roman Catholic missionary order, in the nineteenth-century
United States. This dataset contains only the most interesting data recorded
in the full Paulist mission chronicles. The founding members of the Paulist
Fathers began as members of the Redemptorist order. Their chronicles include
both the missions held as Redemptorists and as Paulists. This transcription
only includes missions up to the year 1893; the Paulist Chronicles contain
more records than are transcribed here, and the Paulists continued holding
missions for many more years than are recorded in the Chronicles.
