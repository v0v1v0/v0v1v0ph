<h2>hacksig: A Tidy Framework to Hack Gene Expression Signatures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>hacksig</code> package has been designed for the purpose of simplifying the way
in which gene expression signatures scores are computed. It is a manually
curated collection of gene expression signatures found in literature and makes
use of three different single sample score calculation methods. Moreover,
parallel computation is supported through the <code>future</code> framework.
</p>


<h3>Get gene signatures scores in different ways</h3>

<p>The main function of the package is <code>hack_sig()</code> and it can be used to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> obtain single sample scores with one of three methods (z-score, ssGSEA,
singscore) for a custom list of gene signatures;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> obtain single sample scores for a number of manually curated gene signatures
either with the original publication method or with one of the three single
sample methods.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once single sample scores are obtained, you can assign your samples into
signature classes with <code>hack_class()</code>.
</p>
<p>In addition, other more complex methods are implemented through:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>hack_cinsarc()</code>, for the CINSARC classification;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hack_estimate()</code>, for the ESTIMATE method;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hack_immunophenoscore()</code>, for the Immunophenoscore.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Information about implemented signatures can be obtained with <code>get_sig_info()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Check if gene signatures are applicable to your data</h3>

<p>Sometimes your gene expression matrix can miss some genes due to some prior
filtering procedure. The function <code>check_sig()</code> can be used to check how many
genes your expression matrix contain for every input signature.
