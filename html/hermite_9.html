<h2>Hot 100 hits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data corresponds to the 965 "number 1" hits on the Hot 100 chart over the
period January 1955 to December 2003. For a recording that reaches the
number one spot, <em>Weeks</em> measures the number of
weeks that it stays at number one. The covariates are: <em>Elvis</em> = 1 if the
recording was by Elvis Presley, = 0 otherwise; <em>Beatles</em> = 1 if the
recording was by the Beatles, = 0 otherwise; <em>Group</em> = 1 if the
recording was by a band, = 0 otherwise;
<em>Female</em> = 1 if the artist was a solo female, = 0
otherwise; <em>Male</em> = 1 if the artist was a solo male, = 0
otherwise; <em>Inst</em> = 1 if the recording was purely
instrumental, = 0 otherwise; and <em>NonCon</em> = 1 if
the recording topped the charts in nonconsecutive
weeks, = 0 otherwise.
