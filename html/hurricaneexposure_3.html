<h2>Hurricane exposure by rain for counties</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a list of US counties, based on their 5-digit Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes, boundaries on
the range of years to be considered, thresholds for distance between each
county and the storm track, as well as minimum rainfall over a certain time
window for the county to be considered "exposed" to the
storm. Based on these inputs, the function returns a dataframe with the
subset of Atlantic basin storms meeting those criteria for each of the listed
counties.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">county_rain(
  counties,
  start_year,
  end_year,
  rain_limit,
  dist_limit,
  days_included = c(-2, -1, 0, 1)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>counties</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector of the five-digit Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) codes for counties for which the user wants to
determine storm exposure.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start_year</code></td>
<td>
<p>Four-digit integer with first year to consider.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end_year</code></td>
<td>
<p>Four-digit integer with last year to consider.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rain_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum of rainfall, in millimeters, summed across the days
selected to be included (<code>days_included</code>), that must fall in a
county for the county to be classified as "exposed" to the storm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum distance, in kilometers, of how close the storm
track must come to the county's population mean center to classify
the county as "exposed" to the storm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>days_included</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector listing the days to include when
calculating total precipitation. Negative numbers are days before the
closest date of the storm to a county. For example,
<code>c(-1, 0, 1)</code> would calculate rain for a county as the sum of the
rainfall for the day before, the day of, and the day after the date when
the storm center was closest to the county center. Values can range from
-5 to 3 (i.e., at most, you can calculate the total rainfall from five days
to three days after the day when the storm is closest to the
county).</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a dataframe with a row for each county-storm pair and with
columns for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>storm_id</code>: Unique storm identifier with the storm name and year,
separated by a hyphen(e.g., "Alberto-1988",
"Katrina-2005")
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fips</code>: County's 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) code
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>closest_date</code>: Date (based on local time) of the closest
approach of the storm to the county's population
mean center.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>storm_dist</code>: Minimum distance (in kilometers) between the storm's
track and the county's population mean center.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tot_precip</code>: Cumulative rainfall, in millimeters, in the
county for the days selected using the
<code>days_included</code> option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>local_time</code>: Local time of the closest approach of the storm to the
county's population mean center, based on storm tracks
linearly interpolated to 15-minute increments.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>closest_time_utc</code>: Time, in UTC, of the closest approach of the
storm to the county's population mean center,
based on storm tracks linearly interpolated to
15-minute increments.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
