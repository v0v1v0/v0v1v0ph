<h2>Calculate conditional cue validity, which includes reversing and ranks.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Conditional cue validity is the validity of a cue taking into account
decisions already made by higher-ranked cues.  For a single cue, it
is the same as cue validity.  For two cues, the higher validity cue will
have conditional cue validity = cue validity.  However, the remaining cue
will have its validity re-calculated on just those pairs of object where
cue validity did not discriminate.  In the case of binary data, there will
be many pairs where the first cue did not discriminate.  With real-valued
data, there may be no such cases.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">conditionalCueValidityComplete(data, criterion_col, cols_to_fit)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The matrix or data.frame whose columns are treated as cues.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>criterion_col</code></td>
<td>
<p>The index of the column used as criterion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cols_to_fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of indexes of the columns to calculate cue
validity for.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of vectors with values for each column in cols_to_fit:
$cue_validities: The validities based on reversed value, numbers ranging
from 0 to 1.  It will include NA if the validity cannot be calculated
(e.g. higher-validity cues made decisions for all cases in the data set).
$cue_ranks: Rank order from 1 to # of cues in cols_to_fit.  Will be NA if 
validity was NA.
$cue_directions: 1 if cue is in same direction as criterion, -1 if
reversed.  Will be NA if validity was NA.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The data below differentiates between cue validity and conditional cue
# validity.  Cue validity of x1 is 1.0.  Cue validity of x2 is 0.5.
# But after you've chosen x1 as the highest-validity cue, only row2
# vs. row3 is undecided  x2 predictions correctly on those, so its
# conditional cue validity is 1.0 (conditional on x1 being first).
data &lt;- cbind(y=c(5,4,3), x1=c(1,0,0), x2=c(0,1,0))
out &lt;- conditionalCueValidityComplete(data, 1, c(2:3))
# This tells you both cues had validity 1-- it returns 1, 1.
out$cue_validities
# This tells you to choose x1 first-- it returns 1, 0.
out$cue_ranks
# This tells you they already point in the correct direction.
out$cue_directions
# For a case with a negative cue direction, try this data:
data2 &lt;- cbind(y=c(5,4,3), x1=c(1,0,0), x2=c(1,0,1))
conditionalCueValidityComplete(data2, 1, c(2:3))
