<h2>Test for gene-environment interaction</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performes a gene-environment test to check if <code>haplin</code> estimates of relative risks change over strata of environment. It is typically applied to the output from <code>haplinStrat</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gxe(object.list)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object.list</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of <code>haplin</code> results, almost always the output from <code>haplinStrat</code>. The first element is the result of running <code>haplin</code> on all data; the remaining elements are the results for each stratum separately.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>haplinStrat</code> runs <code>haplin</code> first on the entire input data file, then on each stratum separately. The results from <code>haplinStrat</code> are similar to just manually splitting the file into strata and running <code>haplin</code> on each, with one important difference, however: Since some strata may be small etc., haplin might conceivably choose different haplotypes in different strata, and also choose different reference haplotypes. When first running haplin on the entire file, <code>haplinStrat</code> saves the selected haplotypes and chosen reference category. Then, in the strata-specific runs haplinStrat forces haplin to choose the same haplotypes/reference category in all runs, so that results from different strata are comparable.
When applying <code>gxe</code> to the output from haplinStrat, it will test whether there is a statistically significant change in parameter estimates from stratum to stratum, i.e. a gene-environment interaction since strata usually are defined by an environmental exposure.
<code>gxe</code> uses Wald tests to test for interactions. It always tests whether there is change in haplotype frequencies from stratum to stratum. More importantly, it separately tests whether any genetic effects, such as fetal genetic effects, maternal effects, or parent-of-origin effects, change significantly over strata.
<code>gxe</code> can also be run from within <code>haplinSlide</code> by using the <code>strata</code> argument in <code>haplinSlide</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with one row for each test that is performed (haplo.freq is the first, the remaining depend on the model that has been estimated). The Wald chi-squared test value, degrees-of-freedom, and resulting p-value are reported.
</p>


<h3>NOTE:</h3>

<p>In the future, the structure of the output from gxe will change. In particular, measures of ratios of relative risks will be reported in addition to the p-values</p>
