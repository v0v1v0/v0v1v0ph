<h2> Students Estimates of Lecture Room Width </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lecture room width estimated by students in two different units.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("roomwidth")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 113 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>unit</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>feet</code> and <code>metres</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>width</dt>
<dd>
<p>the estimated width of the lecture room.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Shortly after metric units of length were officially introduced
in Australia, each of a group of 44 students was asked to guess,
to the nearest metre, the width of the lecture hall in which 
they were sitting. Another group of 69 students in the same room   
was asked to guess the width in feet, to the nearest foot. The
data were collected by Professor T. Lewis and are taken 
from Hand et al (1994). The main question is whether estimation in feet and 
in metres gives different results.
