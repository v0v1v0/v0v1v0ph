<h2>Coerces an object to a <code>Dna</code> object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Coerces an object that contains DNA sequences to an object of Class <code>Dna</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'matrix'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'data.frame'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'list'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'character'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'Haplotype'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'DNAbin'
as.dna(x)
## S4 method for signature 'phyDat'
as.dna(x)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p> a matrix, a data.frame, a list, a character, an object of class <code>Haplotype</code>, <code>DNAbin</code> <code>{ape}</code> or <code>phyDat</code> <code>{phangorn}</code> object containing the DNA sequences.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Elements of the list must be vectors. Each element of the list contains a single DNA sequence. If the sequence lengths differ, the longest sequence is taken into account and gaps are introduced to the shorter sequences at the end of the matrix in the slot <code>sequence</code>. Sequence length information is stored in the slot <code>seqlengths</code>.
</p>
<p>Valid characters for the slot <code>sequence</code> are "A","C","G","T","a","c","g","t","-","?". During the conversion of the object to the class <code>Dna</code>, integers 0,1,2,3,4,5 or characters "0","1","2","3","4","5" are converted to "?","A","C","G","T","-", respectively. Invalid characters are replaced with "?" with a warning message.  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class <code>Dna.</code>
</p>
