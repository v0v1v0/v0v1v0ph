<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Variables are denoted by integers, the lower the number identifying the variable 
the faster its category subscript changes in the vectorized contingency table. Suppose that the variables are 1 and 2 
with categories k_1, k_2, the joint frequencies yij, where i=1,...,k_1, j=1,...,k_2, 
are arranged in a vector so that the subscript i changes faster than j. If <code>strata</code> is greater than one, the
vectorized contingency tables must be entered strata by strata. So that, for example, if the variables are distinguished in 
responses and covariates, the categories of the covariates determine the strata and the data are arranged 
in such a way that the categories of the response variable changes faster than the categories of covariate. The names of the variables in <code>names</code> must be declared according to the order of the variables.  
</p>
<p>The list <code>marg</code> of the marginal sets of a complete hierarchical marginal parameterization, together with the types of logits for the variables,
must be  created by the function ‘marg.list’. See the help of this function for more details.
If <code>marg</code> is not specified the multivariate logit model by Glonek and McCullagh (1995) 
with interactions of type local is used. The list  <code>marg</code> is used to create the link function 
Cln(Mm) and its derivative (m is the vector of expected frequencies).
</p>
<p>If the model is defined in the form Cln(Mm) = Xbeta, the matrix X 
has to be declared (see the function ‘create.XMAT’). If there are only nullity constraints on parameters, the model is in the form ECln(Mm)=0 and X is ignored. In such a case, E can be declared as matrix or it is automatically constructed if <code>sel</code> is declared. If <code>sel</code> is not NULL, then the model is defined under equality constraints, i.e. ECln(Mm)=0.
When <code>X</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>sel</code> are left at default level, a saturated model is defined.  
</p>
<p>For models with inequality constraints on marginal parameters, the input argument <code>dismarg</code> is declared as a list whose components are of type: <code>list(marg=c(1,2),int=list(c(1),c(1,2)),</code> <code>types=c("g","l" ))</code>, with elements
<code>marg</code>: the marginal set, <code>int</code>: the list of the interaction subject to inequality constraint, and <code>types</code>: the logit 
used for every variable ("g"=global, "l"=local, "c"=continuation, "rc"=reverse continuation, 
"r"=recursive, "b"=baseline, "marg" is assigned  to each variable not belonging 
to the marginal set).  This list is used to create the link function 
Cln(Mm) and its derivative for the inequality constraints. 
</p>
<p>The matrix Z is of dimension c x s, where c is the number of counts 
and s is the number of strata or populations. 
Thus, the rows correspond to the number of observations  and 
the columns correspond to the strata.  A 1 in 
row i and column j means that the ith count comes 
from the jth stratum.  Note that Z has exactly 
one 1 in each row, and at least one 1 in each 
column.  When the population matrix Z 
is a column vector of 1 indicates that all 
the counts come from the same and only stratum.
For hmm models, it is assumed that all 
the strata have  the same number of response levels. 
If Z is not given, a population Z matrix corresponding 
to data entered by <code>strata</code> is defined and ZF=Z. 
For non-zero ZF, the columns 
are a subset of the columns in Z.
If the jth column of Z is included in ZF, then the 
sample size of the jth stratum is considered fixed, otherwise
if the jth column of Z is NOT included in ZF, the 
jth stratum sample size is taken to be a realization 
of a Poisson random variable.  As ZF=Z the sample size in every stratum 
is fixed; this 
is the (product-)multinomial setting.  
</p>
<p>The formula  of the reference log-linear model must be defined using the names of the variables declared in <code>names</code>, for example
<code>names&lt;-c("A","B","C","D")</code>, <code>formula=~A*C*D+B*C*D+A:B</code>. The interactions not involved in <code>formula</code> cannot be further constrained in 
the marginal model. The default <code>formula = NULL</code> indicates the saturated log-linear model as reference model.
The likelihood function of the reference model is maximized by ‘hmmm.mlfit’ under the constraints ECln(Mm)=0 on the marginal parameters.
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>dismarg</code> and <code>formula</code> can be used only if <code>strata=1</code>.</p>
