<h2>Subsetting for Bimodal/Variance Emulators</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a collection of bimodal or stochastic emulators and subsets by output name.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">subset_emulators(emulators, output_names)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>emulators</code></td>
<td>
<p>A set of emulators, often in nested form</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the desired outputs</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It can be useful to consider only a subset of outputs. In the normal case, this can be
easily achieved; however, when the emulators are in a nested structure such as that
provided by emulator_from_data with emulator_type = 'variance' or 'bimodal', it can
be more involved. This function allows the easy selecting of emulators by name, returning a
subset of them in the same form as the original object.
</p>
<p>This function is compatible with ‘standard’ emulators; that is, those in a simple
list, equivalent to subsetting over the collection of output names of the emulators
that exist in <code>output_names</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of the same form as 'emulators'.
