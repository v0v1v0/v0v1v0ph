<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the mechanical vulnerability of a
structural element, like a hard coral colony, to fluid flow. While
developed for corals, and originally called the Colony Shape Factor
(CSF), the function is applicable to any attached, rigid cantilever
type structure. CSF is dimensionless and can be used to compare the
vulnerability among structures. Mechanistically, if the CSF of a
structure becomes greater than the dislodgement mechanical threshold,
breakage occurs. This threshold is a function of material tensile
strength and inversely related to fluid velocity and density
(Madin &amp; Connolly 2006).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A value for csf or if keep_data = TRUE, a list containing the
colony shape factor (csf), the parallel to flow (dy) and perpendicular
(dx) diameters of the cantilever base, and the bending moment (mom).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The orientation of the 3D mesh is important for this function.
The function assumes the fluid flow is parallel with the y-axis.
The function also assumes the base of the cantilever over which the
bending moment acts can be approximated as an ellipse with the diameter
on the y-axis parallel with flow (dy). You can set a z_min if the base
of your mesh is not flat at the base (i.e., shift the plane upon which
the cantilever is attached upwards). The function output includes dy
and dx for monitoring anticipated values.
