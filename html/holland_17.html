<h2>Congruence Index according to Healy &amp; Mourton (1983)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function computes the two-letter congruence index according to Healy &amp; Mourton (1983).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">con_twoletter_holland(a, b)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector with person Holland codes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector with environment Holland codes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function finds the congruence according to Healy &amp; Mourton (1983) between the two-letter Holland codes given in argument a, which is the person code, and argument b, which is the environment code. The Index as defined by Healy &amp; Mourton (1983) targets (only) two letters from the Holland code. The degree of congruence is output, according to its definition by Healy &amp; Mourton (1983), as a reciprocal value of a distance. This means, for example, that a value of '3' is the result for a perfect fit of two two-letter codes !
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a numeric with value for congruence.
