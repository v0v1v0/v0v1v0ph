<h2>Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A likelihood function for the competitors at the Ladies' Free Skate
at the 2002 Winter Olympics
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">skating</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Three objects 
<code>skating</code>, a log-likelihood function for the competitors'
strengths, <code>skating_table</code>, an order table for each of the 9
judges, and <code>skating_maxp</code>, the result of <code>maxp(skating)</code>,
which is included to save time in the examples.
</p>
<p>These objects can be generated by running script
<code>inst/skating.Rmd</code>, which includes some further discussion and
technical documentation.  The dataset is interesting because it has
been analysed by many workers, including Lock and Lock, for
consistency between the judges.
</p>
<p>Note that file is structured so that each competitor is a row, and
each judge is a column.  Function <code>rank_likelihood()</code> requires a
transpose of this to operate.
</p>
<p>Object <code>skating_table</code> is an order table, taken from Lock and
Lock.  It corrects what appears to be an error in which judge 5 ranked
both Butyrskaya and Kettunen 12; there is no 13.  Using EM, I reckon
that Butyrskaya should be ranked twelfth and Kettunen thirteenth.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is an (<code>Rbuildignore</code>-d) discussion of a
<code>skeleton</code> dataset in the <code>inst/</code> directory of the repo,
it's easy to confuse this with <code>skating</code>.
