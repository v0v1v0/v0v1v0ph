<h2>Convert a request to a mock file path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Requests are translated to mock file paths according to several rules that
incorporate the request method, URL, query parameters, and body.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">build_mock_url(req)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>req</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>httr2_request</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First, the request protocol, such as "https://", is removed from the URL.
Second, if the request URL contains a query string, it will be popped off,
hashed by <code>digest::digest()</code>, and the first six characters appended to the
file being read. Third, request bodies are similarly hashed and
appended. Finally, if a request method other than GET is used it will be
appended to the end of the end of the file name.
</p>
<p>Mock file paths also have a file extension appended, based on the
<code>Content-Type</code> of the response, though this function, which is only concerned
with the request, does not add the extension. In an
HTTP API, a "directory" itself is a resource,
so the extension allows distinguishing directories and files in the file
system. That is, a mocked <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠GET http://example.com/api/⁠</code> may read a
"example.com/api.json" file, while
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠GET http://example.com/api/object1/⁠</code> reads "example.com/api/object1.json".
</p>
<p>Other examples:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠GET http://example.com/api/object1/?a=1⁠</code> may read
"example.com/api/object1-b64371.xml".
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠POST http://example.com/api/object1/?a=1⁠</code> may read
"example.com/api/object1-b64371-POST.json".
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you are trying to guess the mock file paths corresponding to a
test for which you intend to create a mock file manually,
instead of trying to build the URL, you should run the test
with <code>with_mock_api()</code> as the error message will contain the mock file path.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A file path and name, without an extension. The file, or a file with
some extension appended, may or may not
exist: existence is not a concern of this function.
