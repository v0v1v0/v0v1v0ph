<h2>Financial Projections and Planning for Healthcare Practices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides a shiny interface for a free, open-source managerial
accounting-like system for healthcare practices. This package allows
healthcare administrators to project revenue with monthly adjustments
and procedure-specific boosts up to a 3-year period. Granular data
(patient-level) to aggregated data (department- or hospital-level) can
all be used as valid inputs provided historical volume and revenue
data is available.
