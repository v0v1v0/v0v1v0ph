<p>The heatex function calculates heat storage in the body and the components of heat exchange (conductive, convective, radiative and evaporative) between the body and the environment during physical activity based on the principles of partitional calorimetry. The function is suitable for walking, running or cycling, and for air velocities up to 4 m.s-1.</p>

</p>
<p>4. Partitional Calorimetry Equations
</p>
<p>4.1 Calculation of the energy equivalent of oxygen, EE
(modified from Parsons, 1993)
EE (J.L O2-1) = (0.23 x RER + 0.77) x 21 166

</p>
<p>4.5 Calculation of body heat storage, S

</p>
<p>4.10 Calculation of the maximal evaporative capacity of the environment, Emax

where wt = body mass (g), fluid/food intake and urine/faeces loss are in grams, the expression 0.019 x VO2 x (44-Pa) accounts for respiratory weight loss in g.min-1 (Mitchell et al., 1972), VO2= oxygen uptake in L.min-1, t = observation time (min), and AD = body surface area (m2).
