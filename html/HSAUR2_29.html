<h2> Blood Screening Data </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and measurements of 
two plasma proteins (fibrinogen and globulin).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("plasma")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 32 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>fibrinogen</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the fibrinogen level in the blood.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>globulin</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the globulin level in the blood.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ESR</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, either less or
greater 20 mm / hour. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which
red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle out of suspension in blood
plasma, when measured under standard conditions. If the ESR increases
when the level of certain proteins in the blood plasma rise in
association with conditions such as rheumatic diseases, chronic
infections and malignant diseases, its determination might be
useful in screening blood samples taken form people suspected
to being suffering from one of the conditions mentioned. The
absolute value of the ESR is not of great importance rather it
is whether it is less than 20mm/hr since lower values indicate
a healthy individual.
</p>
<p>The question of interest is whether there is any association  
between the probability of an ESR reading greater than 20mm/hr
and the levels of the two plasma proteins. If there is not then 
the determination of ESR would not be useful for diagnostic purposes.
