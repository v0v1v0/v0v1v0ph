<h2>
Allocation of matched units to intervention arms
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allocates units belonging to a single submatch to separate intervention arms. This ensures that the resulting intervention groups are homogeneous in respect to the variables that were used to construct the distance/dissimilarity matrix for the non-bipartite matching. The number of resulting intervention groups is equal to the 'g' (i.e. submatch size) used in the multigroup non-bipartite matching.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">match.allocate(xmat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xmat</code></td>
<td>

<p>A binary matching matrix or a matching vector given by match.bb-function.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector where each element indicates to which group the observation was randomized to. The group names are "Group_A", "Group_B", "Group_C", ... until 'g' letters, where 'g' was the size of submatches.
