<h2>ExpoCast SEEM3 Consensus Exposure Model Predictions for Chemical Intake Rates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are a subset of the Bayesian inferrences reported by Ring et al.
(2019) for a consensus model of twelve exposue predictors. The predictors
were calibrated based upon their ability to predict intake rates inferred
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). They reflect the
populaton median intake rate (mg/kg body weight/day), with uncertainty.
