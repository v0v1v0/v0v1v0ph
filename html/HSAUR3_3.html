<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data arise from a study reported in Kelsey and Hardy (1975) which was designed to 
investigate whether driving a car is a risk factor for low back pain resulting from 
acute herniated lumbar intervertebral discs (AHLID). A case-control study was used 
with cases selected from people who had recently had X-rays taken of the lower back 
and had been diagnosed as having AHLID. The controls were taken from patients admitted 
to the same hospital as a case with a condition unrelated to the spine. Further matching 
was made on age and sex and a total of 217 matched pairs were recruited, consisting of 
89 female pairs and 128 male pairs.
