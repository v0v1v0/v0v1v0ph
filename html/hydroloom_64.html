<h2>Rescale Aggregate id Measure to id Measure</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a aggregate id (e.g. reachcode) measure and the from and
to measure for a id (e.g. comid flowline), returns the measure along the
id line. This is a utility specific to the NHDPlus data model where
many comid flowlines make up a single reachcode / reach. "Measures"
are typically referenced to reaches. Flowlines have a stated from-measure /
to-measure. In some cases it is useful to rescale the measure such that it
is relative only to the flowline.
</p>
<p>from is downstream – 0 is the outlet
to is upstream – 100 is the inlet
</p>
