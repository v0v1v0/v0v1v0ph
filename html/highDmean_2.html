<h2>An example of GO term data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the gene expressions for a Gene Ontology (GO) term
on two phenotype groups: BCR/ABL and NEG.
The id of the GO term is <code>GO:0000003</code>.
The raw dataset is taken from <code>ALL</code> package.
The data were preprocessed, for which the details are  elaborated in Zhang and Wang (2020).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GO_example
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with two subsets of gene expression data.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>X</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix containing gene expressions for the BCR/ABL group. The row id is for patient and the
column id is for gene.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Y</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix containing gene expressions for the NEG group. The row id is for patient and the
column id is for gene.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
