<h2>Tox21 2015 Active Hit Calls (EPA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ToxCast and Tox21 research programs employ batteries of high-throughput
assays to assess chemical bioactivity in vitro. Not every chemical is tested
through every assay. Most assays are conducted in concentration response,
and each corresponding assay endpoint is analyzed statistically to determine
if there is a concentration-dependent response or "hit" using the ToxCast
Pipeline.  Most assay endpoint-chemical combinations are non-responsive.
Here, only the hits are treated as potential indicators of bioactivity. This
bioactivity does not have a direct toxicological interpretation. The October
2015 release (invitrodb_v2) of the ToxCast and Tox21 data were used for this
analysis. This object contains just the chemicals in Wambaugh et al. (2019)
and only the quantiles across all assays for the ACC.
