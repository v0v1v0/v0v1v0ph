<h2>Event identification (using a peak over threshold algorithm)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identify events using a specified threshold value over which an event is considered to have occurred.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">eventPOT(data, threshold = 0, min.diff = 1, out.style = "summary")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data vector</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value above which an event is considered to have occurred</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>Spacing required for two events to be considered separate</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out.style</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of output (currently either "summary" or "none")</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>threshold</code> can be thought of a value below which the <code>data</code> are considered to be "zero".
The <code>min.diff</code> can be viewed as the minimum spacing for event independence.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>By default, the <code>out.style</code> returns the indices of the maximum in each event, as well as the value of
the maximum and the sum of the <code>data</code> in each event, alongside the start and end of the events. Otherwise just
the indices of start and end of events as a two column dataframe are returned.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example using streamflow data
bf = baseflowB(dataBassRiver, alpha = 0.925)
qf = dataBassRiver - bf$bf
events = eventPOT(qf)
plotEvents(qf, dates = NULL, events = events, type = "lineover",
   main = "Events (plotted on quickflow)")
plotEvents(dataBassRiver, dates = NULL, events = events, type = "lineover",
   main = "Events (plotted on streamflow)")

# Examples using rainfall data
events = eventPOT(dataLoch, threshold = 0, min.diff = 1)
plotEvents(dataLoch, dates = NULL, events = events, type = "hyet",
   main = "Rainfall Events (threshold = 0, min.diff = 1)")

events = eventPOT(dataLoch, threshold = 2, min.diff = 2)
plotEvents(dataLoch, dates = NULL, events = events, type = "hyet",
   main = "Rainfall Events (threshold = 2, min.diff = 2)")
