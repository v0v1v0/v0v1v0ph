<h2>
Wide-format data of the Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer experiment using the VCaP cell line.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>VCaP cancer cells were injected orthotopically into the prostate of mice and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) was followed. The animals were castrated on two subsequent weeks, after which the castration-resistant tumors were allowed to emerge. Since PSA reached pre-castration levels, the animals were non-bipartite matched and allocated to separate intervention arms (at week 10). 3 different interventions are presented here, with 'Vehicle' as a comparison point and MDV3100 and ARN-509 tested for reducing PSA and its correlated tumor size.
