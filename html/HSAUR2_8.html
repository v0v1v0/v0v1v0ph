<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Contemporary China is on the leading edge of a sexual revolution, with tremendous
regional and generational differences that provide unparalleled natural experiments
for analysis of the antecedents and outcomes of sexual behavior. 
The Chinese Health and Family Life Study, conducted 1999–2000 as a collaborative
research project of the Universities of Chicago, Beijing, and North Carolina, provides
a baseline from which to anticipate and track future changes.
Specifically, this study produces a baseline set of results on sexual behavior
and disease patterns, using a nationally representative probability sample.   
The Chinese Health and Family Life Survey sampled
60 villages and urban neighborhoods chosen in such a way
as to represent the full geographical and socioeconomic   
range of contemporary China excluding Hong Kong and
Tibet. Eighty-three individuals were chosen at random for
each location from official registers of adults aged between
20 and 64 years to target a sample of 5000 individuals in
total. Here, we restrict our attention to women with current male partners
for whom no information was missing, leading to a sample
of 1534 women. The data have been extracted as given in the example section.
