<h2>A grid and lattice combination</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>GridLat</code> keeps together a grid of points and a
lattice of links between those points.
</p>
<p>It has 3 components:
</p>
<p>* A character name, which isn't used much in anger but might help you remember what's gone into it.
* A dataframe containing the points of the lattice (the vertices), which each have an ID, a longitude and latitude.
* A dataframe containing the edges of the lattice, joining the points.
