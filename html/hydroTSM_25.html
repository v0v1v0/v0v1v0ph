Hydrometeorological time series for "Cauquenes en El Arrayan" catchment
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Daily time series of precipitation, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and observed streamflows for the catchment draining into the 'Cauquenes en El Arrayan' streamflow station (Cod.BNA: 7336001, Lat:-36.02, Lon:-72.38). This catchment is located in El Maule Region in Chile, with a pluvial regime, a total drainage area of 622.1 km2, and elevations ranging from 134 to 736 m a.s.l. Data were downloaded from the CAMELS-CL dataset (<a href="https://camels.cr2.cl">https://camels.cr2.cl</a>) from 01/Jan/1979 to 31/Dec/2019 (including some missing values).
