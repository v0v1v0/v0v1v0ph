<h2>Function dpsdPosSample</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to sample posterior of DPSD model with positive d'</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dpsdPosSample(dat, M = 5000, keep = (M/10):M, getDIC = TRUE, jump = 0.01)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame that must include variables
Scond,cond,sub,item,lag,resp.  Scond indexes studied/new, whereas
cond indexes conditions nested within the studied or new
conditions.  Indexes for Scond,cond, sub, item, and respone must
start at zero and have no gaps (i.e., no skipped subject numbers). Lags
must be zero-centered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of MCMC iterations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which MCMC iterations should be included in estimates and
returned.  Use keep to both get ride of burn-in, and thin chains if
necessary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>getDIC</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the function compute DIC value?  This
takes a while if M is large.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jump</code></td>
<td>
<p>The criteria and decorrelating steps utilize
Matropolis-Hastings sampling routines, which require tuning.  All
MCMC functions should self-tune during the burnin period (iterations
before keep), and they will alert you to the success of tuning.  If
acceptance rates are too low, "jump" should be decreased, if they
are too hight, "jump" should be increased.  Alternatively, or in
addition to adjusting "jump", simply increase the burnin period
which will allow the function more time to self-tune.</p>
