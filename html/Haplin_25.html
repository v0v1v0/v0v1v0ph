<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>hapRelEff</code> compares two study designs for genetic association analysis, using a term called relative efficiency. 
The relative efficiency is defined as the ratio of variances of estimators for the same parameter, computed from two
different designs, or equivalently, the ratio of the sample sizes needed for each of the two designs to achieve the same level and power. The number of genotyped individuals within each design is accounted for.
The relative efficiency estimated under the null hypothesis, i.e., when all relative risks are equal to one, is known as the Pitman efficiency.
To compute the variance-covariance estimates for each design, <code>hapRelEff</code> calls the function <code>hapCovar</code>, which calculates the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix 
by applying the log-linear model combined with the EM algorithm.
</p>
<p>The relative efficiency can be computed for fetal effects, maternal effects and parent-of-origin effect, 
as well as effects on X-chromosome markers. 
Various study designs, i.e., case-parent triads, the standard case-control design, the hybrid design, and all intermediate designs, can be compared.
</p>
<p>Note that the exact number of case families and control families in the reference or comparison design is irrelevant, as this will be accounted for in the relative efficiency estimate.
However, the ratio of control families to case families within the reference or comparison design must be specified correctly. See the Examples section.
</p>
<p>Specifying haplotype risks:<br>
The number of haplotypes used in the simulations is determined by the <code>nall</code> argument, since <code>prod(nall)</code> different haplotypes can be made from the specified number of markers, <code>length(nall)</code>. 
The arguments <code>haplo.freq</code>, <code>RR</code>, <code>RRcm</code>, <code>RRcf</code>, <code>RRstar</code>, <code>RR.mat</code>, and <code>RRstar.mat</code> are all lists, containing vectors of length equal to the number of haplotypes, specifying the relative risk etc. associated with each haplotype.
However, the function will work without using the list format.
The haplotypes are determined by creating all possible haplotypes from the given markers, in a sequence where the first marker varies mostly quickly. 
For instance, if <code>nall = c(3,2)</code>, the first marker has 3 alleles, the second has 2, and 6 haplotypes are possible. Taken in order, the haplotypes are 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 1-2, 2-2, and 3-2. 
When specifying, say, <code>RR = c(1,2,1,1,1,1)</code> the haplotype 2-1 has a double risk compared to the rest. 
The simplest example would be with <code>nall = c(2)</code> and <code>RR = c(1,2)</code>, which would simulate a single SNP where the second allele has a double risk.
</p>
<p>Specifying genetic effects:<br>
Standard fetal effects are specified by the arguments <code>RR</code> and <code>RRstar</code>, 
whereas parent-of-origin effects are addressed by the arguments <code>RRcm</code>, <code>RRcf</code> and <code>RRstar</code>. 
Maternal effects are included by the additional arguments <code>RRmat</code> and <code>RRstar.mat</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>hapRelEff</code> returns the relative efficiency estimate, comparing two study designs. The first element of the list depicts the relative efficiency for each haplotype analyzed separately. 
If there are more than two possible haplotypes, the second element displays the overall relative efficiency for all haplotypes combined.</p>
