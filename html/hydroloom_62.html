<h2>Navigate all Paths Depth First</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>given a starting node, return all reachable paths. Once visited,
a node is marked as visited and will not take part in a future path.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">navigate_network_dfs(x, starts, direction = "down", reset = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame containing hydroloom compatible network or list
as returned by make_index_ids (for down) or make_fromids
(for up). The list formats avoids recreating the index ids for every call
to navigate network dfs in the case that it needs to be called many times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>starts</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector with ids from x to start at.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>
<p>character "up", "upmain", "down", or "downmain". If "upmain" or
"downmain", x must contain sufficient information to construct an upmain and
downmain network (see details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reset</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical if TRUE, reset graph for each start such that later paths
will have overlapping results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>navigate_network_dfs</code> offers two usage patterns. In the simple case,
you can provide an <code>hy</code> in which case preprocessing is performed automatically,
or you can do the preprocessing ahead of time and provide index ids. The latter
is more complicated but can be much faster in certain circumstances.
</p>
<p><code>hy</code> object:
</p>
<p>If the function will only be called one or a few times, it can be called
with x containing (at a minimum) <code>id</code> and <code>toid</code>. For "upmain" and "downmain"
support, x also requires attributes for determination of the primary upstream
and downstream connection across every junction.
</p>
<p>In this pattern, the <code>hy</code> object will be passed to  make_index_ids
called for every call to <code>navigate_network_dfs</code> and the resulting index ids
will be used for network navigation.
</p>
<p>Index ids:
</p>
<p>If the function will be called repeatedly or index_ids are available for
other reasons, the index_id list as created by make_index_ids (for
downstream) or make_fromids (for upstream) can be used. For "upmain"
and "downmain" support, the <code>main</code> element must be included.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list containing dfs result for each start.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
x &lt;- hy(sf::read_sf(system.file("extdata/new_hope.gpkg", package = "hydroloom")))

x &lt;- add_toids(x, return_dendritic = FALSE)

navigate_network_dfs(x, 8893402)

navigate_network_dfs(x, 8897784, direction = "up")
