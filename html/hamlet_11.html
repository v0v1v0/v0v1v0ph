<h2>
Transform a binary matching matrix to a matching vector
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function transforms a binary matching matrix to a matching vector. A matching vector is of length N where each element indicates the submatch to which the observation belongs to. Notice that this is not the same as the group allocation vector that is provided by the match.allocate-function. The binary matching matrix is of size N x N where 0 indicates that the observations have been part of a different submatch, and 1 indicates that the observations have been part of the same submatch. Diagonal is always 0 although an observation is always in the same submatch with its self.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">match.mat2vec(xmat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xmat</code></td>
<td>

<p>A binary matching matrix 'xmat'
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matching vector where each element indicates submatch the observation belongs to
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Notice that the particular index numbers produced by match.mat2vec may be different to that of the branch and bound solution vector, but that the submatches shared by observations are common.
