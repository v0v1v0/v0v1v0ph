<h2>Stochastic SIR Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An RData object consisting of two data.frames (in a similar fashion to <code>BirthDeath</code>).
The first consists of 30 points in the parameter space (aSI, aIR, aSR), each of which has
been inputted into the Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic version of the model used
in <code>GillespieSIR</code> (but with changed starting conditions) 100 times. The second has
similar form but for 20 unique points, each with 100 repetitions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SIR_stochastic
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of two data.frames <code>training</code> and <code>validation</code>: each has the
following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>aSI</dt>
<dd>
<p>Infection rate</p>
</dd>
<dt>aIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Recovery rate</p>
</dd>
<dt>aSR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Waning immunity rate</p>
</dd>
<dt>I10 (25, 50)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of infected people at t = 10 (25, 50)</p>
</dd>
<dt>R10 (25, 50)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of recovered people at t = 10 (25, 50)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The outputs observed are the numbers of infected (I) and recovered (R) people at time points
t = 10, 25, 50. All outputs display some level of bimodality. The initial conditions to
generate the runs had S(0)=995, I(0)=5, R(0)=0.
