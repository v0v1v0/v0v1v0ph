<h2>Fisherian and Neymanian Methods for Detecting and Measuring Treatment Effect Variation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix
(JRSS-B, 2016) "Randomization Inference for Treatment Effect Variation", for
validly testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects
across observations. The package also implements methods introduced in Ding,
Feller, and Miratrix (JASA, 2019) "Decomposing Treatment Effect Variation", for
measuring the degree of treatment effect heterogeneity explained by
covariates. The package includes wrapper functions implementing the proposed
methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the
results of the tests.
