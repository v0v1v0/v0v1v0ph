<h2>hutils package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides utility functions for, and drawing on, the 'data.table' package. The package also collates useful miscellaneous functions extending base R not available elsewhere. The name is a portmanteau of 'utils' and the author.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package attempts to provide lightweight, fast, and stable functions 
for common operations. 
</p>
<p>By <strong>lightweight</strong>, I mean in terms of dependencies:
we import <code>package:data.table</code> and <code>package:fastmatch</code> which do require
compilation, but in C. Otherwise, all dependencies do not require compilation.
</p>
<p>By <strong>fast</strong>, I mean essentially as fast as possible without using compilation.
</p>
<p>By <strong>stable</strong>, I mean that unit tests <em>should not change</em> unless the major
version also changes.  To make this completely transparent, tests include the version
of their introduction and are guaranteed to not be modified (not even in the sense of
adding extra, independent tests) while the major version is <code>1</code>. Tests that do
not include the version in their filename may be modified from version to version 
(though this will be avoided).
