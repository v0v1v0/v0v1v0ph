<p>In November 25th, 2023, the time zone of this data sete was changed from "none" (i.e., your local time zone was used every time you loaded this dataset)
to GMT+12, in order to avoid missing datetimes at times where daylight saving time ocurred. After this change, the initial DateTime of this dataset changed 
from "1980-01-01 08:15:00 -03" (in my local computer) to "1980-01-01 00:15:00" (everywhere). 
Only two NA elements were removed from the origanl dataset: the first one and the last one.
