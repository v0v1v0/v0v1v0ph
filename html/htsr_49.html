When done, press "Save file settings"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Configure the general layout of the file, entering Title and y-Axis label and

<p>Items 2 and 3 can be performed and repeated in any order. Once they have been validated once,
item 4 can be executed as often as desired.

<p>(*) When point plot is selected, the points overlay the line (point plot doesn't work with bar).
If you want only the points on the plot, configure "line.type" and "line.width" = 0.
