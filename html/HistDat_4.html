<h2>Converts this histogram to a vector. Not recommended if there are many counts

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts this histogram to a vector. Not recommended if there are many counts
as this would result in an incredibly long vector
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'HistDat'
as.vector(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of the class HistDat</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector with the same <code>length</code> as <code>x</code>, but as a 1-D vector with
an element for each count in the counts vector. In other words, all
<code>length(x)</code> observations will be represented as a single element instead of
being just counted as in the original HistDat object.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hd &lt;- HistDat(vals = 1:3, counts = c(1, 2, 1))
as.vector(hd) # returns 1 2 2 3
</code></pre>
